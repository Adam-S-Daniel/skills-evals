"""Validate a routine's `claude/eval-improve-<run id>` branch and apply it.

The improvement loop's routine mode (ADR 0005 amendment 1; ADR 0010). The
eval routine runs `scripts/propose_skill_edit.py` and, when its candidate is
ACCEPTED, pushes one branch holding exactly

    eval-improve/<run id>/summary.json   the loop's record (`<ts>.json`)
    eval-improve/<run id>/report.md      its pull-request body (`<ts>.pr-body.md`)
    eval-improve/<run id>/skill.patch    its registry patch (`<ts>.patch`)

and nothing else. It never opens a pull request. The branch is UNTRUSTED
input (a model run wrote it): `.github/workflows/routine-improve-gate.yml`
runs this script from the default branch's checkout, and it reads the branch
only through git plumbing (`git diff --raw`, `git cat-file`), reusing
`ingest_routine_results.py`'s helpers. Nothing from the branch is executed,
imported or checked out; `apply` hands the validated patch to `git apply` in
a registry checkout, as data.

`eval-improve/` is not `eval-results/`: `claude/eval-improve-*` also matches
the results signal's `claude/eval-*` branch filter, and only the two path
filters keep an improve push from starting a results ingest (and a results
push from starting this gate).

What a branch must look like to pass:

  * its name is `claude/eval-improve-<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>-<6 hex>`;
  * against its merge-base with the default branch it ADDS exactly the three
    files above, regular and non-executable, under its own run id;
  * summary.json is an `accepted` record (schema 1) for the adam-agentskills
    registry at a full commit sha, whose `skill_md` is that registry's
    `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` for the record's own skill,
    and the skill has fixtures under `evals/<skill>/` on the default branch;
  * skill.patch is a unified diff of that one path and nothing else, every
    hunk's line counts agreeing with its header;
  * report.md opens with the loop's own title and holds no closing keyword
    or @mention (it becomes a pull-request body in another repository);
  * every file is under its size cap and valid UTF-8 with no control
    characters.

Subcommands (output is `key=value` lines of validated values, for
$GITHUB_OUTPUT):

  resolve  --event-name NAME --event-path PATH
  validate --repo DIR --base REF --source REF --branch NAME
           [--expect-sha SHA] --out DIR
  apply    --staged DIR --tree DIR --skill-md PATH
  prepare  --staged DIR --tree DIR --skill-md PATH --registry-sha SHA
           --run-id ID [--policy FILE]
  pr-body  --staged DIR --run-id ID --sha SHA --branch NAME
           [--mode draft|auto]                          (body on stdout)
  fire-check SKILL [--holdout NAME]                     (no output; exit 0 or 1)

`prepare` builds the whole registry change on a clean checkout of
adam-agentskills' default branch tip, holding no credential: the patch
(`apply`), a `PURPOSE.md` stub when the skill has none, the plugin's patch
version raised in both manifests (adam-agentskills ADR 0009), a
`docs/skill-impact.md` entry, the README table regenerated, then a second
commit re-pinning `skills.lock` to the first when the lock covers the
skill (the registry's own `scripts/` do the last two). Those are what the
registry's required checks and AGENTS.md ask of a skill edit. It prints the
merge mode: `evals/improve-policy.yml`'s `improve_merge_mode`, or `draft`
when the skill's plugin runs code (`auto_refusal`), so an auto-merged pull
request never touches what adam-agentskills' plugin-runtime-review gates.

`fire-check` is the other end: `routine-eval-fire.yml` runs it before the
fire bearer exists, so a skill the loop would refuse never starts a routine
session. It reuses the loop's own resolution (`skill_fixtures`,
`load_fixtures`, `MIN_FIXTURES`) and harness/registries.yml, read-only and
offline. The loop's last step, finding `<skill>/SKILL.md` in the registry
checkout, needs that checkout, which the fire job does not have, so that
step stays the routine's.
