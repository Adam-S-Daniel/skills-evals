"""Act on a `retire` verdict (#70, part 2): file or update an issue, or open
an auto-merging removal pull request in adam-agentskills.

  retire_skill.py --gates FILE --registry adam-agentskills=PATH
                  [--registry NAME=PATH ...] [--dry-run]
                  [--allow-mode proposal|auto ...] [--usage FILE]

`--gates` is scripts/compute_gates.py's output. A skill acts only when its
verdict there is `retire`, and this script re-checks what that verdict
means before acting: every (fixture, roster model) cell of the cells'
fixtures crossed with the gates file's roster models present exactly once,
and every one `no-benefit` (as harness/gates.py defines the verdict). Any
field of the wrong type is a refusal, never a crash or a pass.
compute_gates lets one skill retire per evaluation; two `retire` verdicts
here are refused, never a pick.

THE MODE is the gates file's `retirement_mode` (from evals/gate-policy.yml;
anything but `auto` is `proposal`):

  * `proposal`: an issue in skills-evals, found by a marker comment in its
    body (`ISSUE_MARKER`) on an issue `github-actions[bot]` opened, is
    created or its body updated. One issue per skill, ever: an open one is
    updated, and a closed one means the skill is already decided, so nothing
    is filed again. A human removes. An issue anyone else wrote is ignored,
    whatever it quotes.
  * `auto` (Adam, 2026-10-25; docs/decisions/0014): a branch
    `retire-skill/<skill>` is prepared in the adam-agentskills checkout; it
    is pushed, a pull request is opened, and auto-merge (merge commit) is
    enabled. No human review, so the branch must pass the registry's
    required checks on its own. Its first commit deletes
    `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill>/`, raises the plugin's patch version in
    both manifests (adam-agentskills ADR 0009), adds a `docs/skill-impact.md`
    entry, drops the skill from `scripts/plugin_layout.json` (the ADR 0013
    layout its tests pin) and regenerates the README skill table with the
    registry's own `scripts/generate_readme_table.py`. When `skills.lock`
    locks the plugin, a second commit re-pins it to the first with the
    registry's `scripts/generate_skills_lock.py --repin`, and
    `--check-current` must then pass (the order that script documents:
    content, commit, re-pin, commit). The two registry scripts run with a
    scrubbed environment (no token reaches them), from the checkout's
    default branch, which the registry's own CI already runs.

`--allow-mode` lists the modes the caller has wired (default: `proposal`
only, the safe one; auto must be named). The scheduled workflow allows only
`proposal`, since auto mode needs a write credential for adam-agentskills
that does not exist yet; a gates file in a mode not allowed exits 2 rather
than doing nothing quietly.

REFUSALS (exit 2, nothing written):

  * any run that is not `--dry-run` outside the scheduled workflow
    (`GITHUB_EVENT_NAME` must be `schedule`): never from a dispatch, a pull
    request or a terminal;
  * in auto mode, any run that is not `--dry-run` outside GitHub Actions
    (`GITHUB_ACTIONS` must be `true`) on the default branch (`GITHUB_REF`
    must be `refs/heads/main`);
  * in auto mode, while any removal pull request (head `retire-skill/...`) is
    open in adam-agentskills: at most one at a time, and an open one holds
    the slot whatever the newest verdict says;
  * in auto mode, a shallow adam-agentskills checkout (the lock re-pin and
    its check read the commit the lock pins, which a shallow clone lacks), a
    skill that is its plugin's last (emptying a plugin is a registry
    decision, and the lock generator refuses it), a
    `scripts/plugin_layout.json` that does not list the skill under its
    plugin, a skill whose removal that registry's `plugin-runtime-review`
    gate would hold for the owner (a `hooks/` or `bin/` directory in the
    skill, or a hook naming a path inside it), which auto-merge cannot
    approve, a skill `scripts/skills_waivers.yml` waives a finding under
    (the waiver goes stale with it and `check_skills.py` exits 1), or a
    skill defining a test that a tracked source elsewhere cites by name (the
    registry's citation test would fail on the dangling name);
  * in auto mode, a skill whose basename is not found exactly once across
    every `--registry` checkout given, or whose one copy is not a real
    `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill>/` directory of adam-agentskills: none
    of `plugins/`, the plugin, its `skills/`, the skill, its manifests or
    `docs/skill-impact.md` may be a symlink or resolve outside the
    checkout. In proposal mode the issue says so instead, since a human
    removes.

`--dry-run` reads (the gates file, the checkouts, and open pull requests or
issues through `gh`), writes nothing, and prints the plan as JSON: the
action, the issue or pull request text, and the commands it would run.

Every GitHub call goes through one function, `gh(args, stdin)` (the `gh`
CLI), and every push through `push(checkout, branch)`, both injectable, so
tests need no network. An error from `gh` is reported by its exit code
only, never its output. Deterministic: no clock; the skill-impact date is
the gates file's `as_of`.

`--usage` is the published `usage/weekly-local.json`; the issue body names
the skill's invocations over the four weeks ending at the gates file's
`as_of` (harness/skill_usage.weight), or says `unknown` when there is no
fresh census. It informs the human; it changes no decision.

The gate guards against honest mistakes, not forged results (Adam,
2026-10-26): anyone who can write the results can also remove a skill.

GUIDANCE SECTIONS (`--target guidance`, skills-evals#124; the functions
named `guidance_*` below, kept apart from the skill path). The gates file's
`guidance` block and `guidance_retirement_mode` decide, read the same way:

  * a `retire` verdict, re-checked as a skill's is: in `proposal` mode an
    issue in skills-evals (`GUIDANCE_ISSUE_MARKER`); in `auto` mode (Adam:
    removal is automatic, 2026-10-10, and its pull requests auto-merge,
    2026-10-25) a branch `retire-guidance/<section>` in the
    `--guidance PATH` checkout of _agent-guidance that removes the
    section's extent from its file (the whole file for a sections/*.md file
    with no other `##`; for base.md, re-copied to the repository's own
    `.claude/hooks/fleet-guidance.md` payload), deletes its
    `agents-md/eval-coverage.yml` row,
    rewrites the manifest's bytes (`check-guidance-coverage.js
    --write-bytes`), adds a typed `remove` entry to
    `docs/guidance-impact.md` whose `Eval:` line names the fixtures, the
    pooled run count (`n=`) and the policy, and regenerates `AGENTS.md`
    exactly as that repository's own instructions say: managed output with
    its trailing newlines stripped, then everything from the `## Repo-
    specific additions` heading LINE (never the first occurrence of the
    substring, which the managed header quotes); pushed, opened and armed
    to auto-merge, one at a time (`retire-guidance/` heads);
  * a `shorten-or-merge` verdict (the section helps only alone): an issue in
    skills-evals (`SHORTEN_ISSUE_MARKER`) in either mode, never a removal.

One action per evaluation: a `retire` first, else the first
`shorten-or-merge` section by name.
