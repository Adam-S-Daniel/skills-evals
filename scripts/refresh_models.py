"""Refresh model AVAILABILITY from the Anthropic Models API.

This is the only network call in the roster feature; `harness/roster.py` is a
pure function over the files this script writes.

Auth is the SAME credential `.github/workflows/eval.yml` already mints — the
short-lived WIF-derived bearer, read from ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN. No new
credential shape is introduced, and none is created here. A plain
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is accepted as the local-development path.

Two outputs:

  --out            {"fetched_at", "models": [{id, display_name, created_at,
                   max_input_tokens, max_tokens, capabilities}, ...]} — every
                   Claude model the API returns. Required; a failure here is
                   loud, because a roster computed from a half-read API would
                   retire models that never went anywhere.

  --admin-report   optional, and SOFT. The Admin API usage report needs
                   ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY, which nobody has provisioned yet; when
                   it is absent this prints a `::notice::` naming that exact
                   variable and moves on, per the fleet's credential
                   convention. Never required, never created here.

No model id appears in this file — it writes down whatever the API returns.
