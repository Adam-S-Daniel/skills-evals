"""Count which Claude models this account actually used, per ISO week.

*** THE OUTPUT OF THIS SCRIPT IS PUBLISHED PUBLICLY. ***

It is committed to the `persistent/eval-results` branch of a PUBLIC repository as
`usage/latest.json` by `scripts/publish_usage_census.sh` (see
`evals/usage/CENSUS.md`). Treat every byte it emits as world-readable,
forever.

That is why the output is `{model_id: {iso_week: count}}` and NOTHING else. It
carries no project names, no directory names, no filesystem paths, no prompt
or reply text, no session ids, no timestamps finer than an ISO week. The
transcripts it reads are full of all of those — `~/.claude/projects/` encodes
the project path in the directory name alone — so the narrowness here is the
whole safety property, not tidiness.

AND THE KEYS ARE NOT TRUSTED EITHER. `message.model` is whatever the routing
layer wrote into the transcript, and it is not always a model id: a Bedrock
inference-profile ARN carries an AWS account number, a Vertex path carries a
GCP project id, a local proxy can put a filesystem path or free prose there.
Copying that verbatim into a top-level key published every one of them. Only
values matching `MODEL_ID_RE` become keys; everything else is counted under
the single key `other`, so the raw turn count this script publishes stays
honest — nothing is silently dropped — without any of those strings crossing
the boundary. The roster's own usage_share() then EXCLUDES `other`, and any
key it cannot rank, from what it divides by: this file's contract is a
truthful count of turns seen, not a truthful denominator for a model's
share, which is roster.py's decision to make. Nothing is ever passed
through `str()` — `str()` of a dict is `repr()`, which publishes its values.
`test/run_tests.py::TestIssue67::test_census_emits_only_model_week_counts_and
_leaks_nothing` and its review-round sibling in `TestIssue67Review` are the
guards on that, and they stay.

Runs on a durable machine (the transcripts are local, and a CI runner has
none). Weekly buckets, not daily: a daily series over one account is a
timeline of when a person was at their desk, and the roster policy only ever
asks about 4- and 8-week windows anyway.

Subagent transcripts are counted, on purpose: a subagent turn is a real API
turn against a real model, it is billed, and the roster's question is "what
does this account run", not "what did a human type at".

`generated_at` is when this script RAN, not when the usage happened — the
usage is in the week buckets. The roster's freshness check reads it as
"how long ago did someone last publish a census", which is the question it
should be asking of a publication timestamp.

NOT stdlib-only: classifying a `message.model` value against the tier ladder
needs `harness/roster.py`'s `tier_words()`/`load_policy()`, and roster.py
itself needs PyYAML. That import is LAZY (see `_require_model_id_re()`), so
importing this module and running `--help` work with no PyYAML installed —
only building an actual census does, and a machine that lacks it gets one
named line on stderr and exit 2, never an ImportError traceback. See
`evals/usage/CENSUS.md` for installing it on the durable machine that runs
this script.

SKILL USAGE rides the same walk when `--weekly-out` is given: how often each
skill was invoked, per ISO week, published beside the model census as
`usage/weekly-local.json` (schema: `harness/skill_usage.py`, the one place it
is defined). The same contract holds, and the keys are just as
untrusted: a `Skill` tool call's `input.skill` and a typed
`<command-name>` are free strings, so a name becomes a key ONLY when it is
in `skill_allowlist()` — skills that already appear by name in this public
repo, as a fixture or a non-coverage row for a non-private registry — and
matches `SKILL_KEY_RE`. Every other Skill tool call counts under `other`; a
typed slash command that is not an allowlisted skill (`/clear`, `/model`)
is not a skill invocation and is not counted at all.

HOOK RUNS from the fleet's git hook runner (agent-checks writes one JSON line
per local run, `--hook-logs`) become `hook` rows in the same weekly file:
per check id, per allowlisted public repository, runs and failures. A check
id is published only when shaped like one, a repository only when it is
public (`public_repos()`); everything else is `other`, and an `all` row per
week counts every run, so the totals do not depend on either allowlist.

PRIVATE EVENTS are the exception, and the only one: `--events-out` writes
one JSON line per skill invocation, with its timestamp, session id and title,
repository and branch. That file is NEVER published publicly:
`scripts/publish_usage_census.sh` commits it only to the private
`persistent/usage-events` branch of adam-agentskills-private (see
`evals/usage/CENSUS.md`, "Private usage events"). Nothing from it reaches
the two public files.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/model_usage_census.py --out usage/latest.json \
        [--weekly-out usage/weekly-local.json] [--events-out events.jsonl] \
        [--hook-logs PATH[:PATH...]]

    (those the mtime prefilter kept). Same window as the models.
