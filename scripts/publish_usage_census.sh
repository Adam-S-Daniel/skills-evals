# Publish the usage census (models and skills) to the `persistent/eval-results`
# branch.
#
# Runs on the OWNER'S DURABLE MACHINE, never in CI or a cloud session: the
# census reads local Claude Code transcripts (~/.claude/projects), which
# those surfaces do not have. See evals/usage/CENSUS.md for what it is, the
# privacy contract on its output, and how to schedule this script.
#
# Steps, all inside one temp dir that is removed on exit:
#   1. shallow-clone skills-evals and run ITS copy of
#      scripts/model_usage_census.py against the real transcripts;
#   2. shallow-clone the persistent/eval-results branch, copy in usage/latest.json
#      (models) and usage/weekly-local.json (skill invocations);
#   3. commit "propagation: usage census [skip ci]" ONLY if the census
#      changed (either file), and push it (one `pull --rebase` retry when
#      the push is not a fast-forward);
#   4. verify with `git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/persistent/eval-results` —
#      a push that printed success is not proof the commit is on the branch;
#   5. then, and only then, publish the PRIVATE per-invocation records
#      (`--events-out`) to the `persistent/usage-events` branch of the private
#      adam-agentskills-private repository: merged by id into
#      events/<YYYY-MM>/<machine>.jsonl, committed only if something was
#      added, pushed and verified the same way. A missing branch is created
#      as an orphan with a README. A failure here never undoes or blocks the
#      public publish: it prints one line without detail and the script exits
#      1 at the end.
#
# Transcript roots: ~/.claude/projects, and under WSL also every existing
# Windows-side root (/mnt/c/Users/*/.claude/projects) and every Cowork root
# below /mnt/c/Users/*/AppData/Local/Claude-Data/*/local-agent-mode-sessions.
# Hook logs: agent-checks' default path, and under WSL the Windows-side
# /mnt/c/Users/*/.local/state/agent-checks/runs.jsonl files that exist.
#
# Credentials: whatever git already has on this machine. This script handles
# no token and reads no secret.
#
# Usage: scripts/publish_usage_census.sh [--dry-run]
#   --dry-run   do everything except push
#
# Output: one summary line — totals only, no model ids, no skill names, no
# paths, never a private record's content.
#
# Test seams (all optional; the defaults are the real thing):
#   SKILLS_EVALS_URL  where to clone from (default: the GitHub repo)
#   CENSUS_PROJECTS   transcript root(s), `:`-separated; replaces every default root
#   CENSUS_NOW        ISO-8601 instant handed to the census as `--now`
#   USAGE_HOOK_LOGS   hook log path(s), `:`-separated; replaces the defaults

# Private usage events

Data, not code. One JSON line per skill invocation and per local git-hook
run, written by skills-evals' `scripts/publish_usage_census.sh` on the
owner's machine into `events/<YYYY-MM>/<machine>.jsonl`, merged by `id`.
Field reference: skills-evals `evals/usage/CENSUS.md`, "Private usage events".

- **Private.** The records carry timestamps, session ids and titles,
  repositories and branches. Only weekly counts are public (skills-evals'
  `persistent/eval-results` branch, `usage/weekly-local.json`).
- **Regenerable for the last 8 weeks only.** The publisher re-creates this
  branch when it is missing, from the transcripts and hook logs still on the
  machine, which covers the census window. Anything older exists only here.
- **No ruleset.** This repository is private, and rulesets cannot protect a
  branch of it on this plan, so nothing guards it against deletion or a force
  push. Do not delete it.
