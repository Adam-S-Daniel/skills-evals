"""Plan the week's routine fires: which cells to measure and which skills to

The rules are the thresholds design's (eval-loop thresholds, version 2,
2026-10-25), A (eligibility), C (stopping) and D (bands); B (acceptance)
stays in scripts/propose_skill_edit.py.

WHAT IS MEASURED. Eval fires are cells, (fixture, roster arm model), of the
reviewed fixtures in evals/scheduled.yml only (ADR 0008): every fire is one
routine-eval-fire.yml dispatch in eval mode with that `model`, both arms, one
trial. A cell's evidence is scripts/compute_gates.py's verdict document,
computed here over the results tree, so the cells are pooled exactly as the
retirement verdict pools them.

GUIDANCE FIXTURES (#124). A scheduled `evals/guidance/<section>/<name>`
fixture (`subject: guidance`) is a cell like any other, fired in eval mode
on its path, but it names a section, not a skill: its evidence is the
section's in-situ cells in the verdict document's `guidance` half
(results/guidance/<section>/..., classified by arm `mode`), and its cell
carries `section` and an empty `skill`. Skill-only logic skips it: the
removal-PR safety band, skill improve eligibility and skill usage weight.
The section's expected extent needs `--guidance`, an _agent-guidance
checkout; without one every guidance cell that has runs stays insufficient
and there are no guidance improve candidates. A guidance section is an
improve CANDIDATE (see IMPROVE ELIGIBILITY), ranked with the skills, and an
eligible one is a `guidance-improve` fire (routine-eval-fire.yml's
guidance-improve mode, ADR 0005's routine guidance improve mode addendum).

THE BANDS (rule D), in order:

  1. safety: every cell of a skill with an open removal pull request in
     adam-agentskills (`retire-skill/<skill>`), no cap, counted first. The
     doc's second safety item, a touch check of an open registry pull
     request's head, is not planned: routine arms run only the registries'
     default branches (ADR 0010 decision 1).
  2. missing evidence, at least 30%: cells with no run on their model,
     cheaper model first, then heaviest model usage (usage/latest.json on the results branch;
     equal weights without it). A cell with two successful fires and still
     no run becomes a `fixture-broken` work item and leaves the queue.
  3. near a decision, at least 20%: insufficient cells, fewest runs first,
     then the cheaper model (every run can decide a cell: harness/gates.py
     checks a confidence sequence after each one).
  Bands 2 and 3 skip every cell of a skill or guidance section whose
  verdict is already `keep` (one confident benefit decides it; band 5
  re-checks it), and order the cheaper model first within a tie (Adam,
  2026-10-31: Sonnet first, Opus only while that has not settled it).
  4. improvements, at least 20%: improve fires for eligible skills and
     guidance-improve fires for eligible guidance sections, highest
     potential value first: value = use x headroom / cost, ties by name.
       use: a skill's usage weight (harness/skill_usage.py, `skill_weights`:
         invocations over 4 weeks); a guidance section's is the census's
         transcript sessions scanned scaled to 28 days by its window
         (`skill_usage.session_rate`), since every session loads the
         guidance. Unknown (no, stale or unreadable census) is neutral, the
         median known skill weight, never zero; a known 0 stays 0.
       headroom: 1 - the pooled with-arm pass rate over the train fixtures
         (a guidance section's: its in-situ `full` arm). Unknown headroom
         gives no value, ranked last, never a guessed 0.
       cost: allowance points, IMPROVE_TRIALS x the sum over the subject's
         fixtures of that fixture's mean `fire_cost` across its cells with a
         known cost. With none known, the median of the known estimates
         across candidates, else the improve charge (neutral, like use).
     Each ranking row records whether use and cost were known.
  5. re-checks: decided cells whose newest run is over 8 weeks old.
  6. bare baselines (ADR 0012, bare baseline addendum; Adam, 2026-10-27:
     "one time per model per version of model"): one fire with `arms:
     bare`, `BARE_TRIALS` trials, per (scheduled fixture that runs in place,
     roster model) that has never had one, heaviest model first, with no
     minimum share, so only room the other bands leave. Done means a bare
     run ingested for that cell (the verdict document's `bare_runs`) or a
     bare fire for it that succeeded or is still running (its run title);
     a refused or failed fire is not done. A new roster model id gets its
     own; nothing is repeated on a clock.

Each band first gets its minimum share of the room left after safety;
what is left then goes to the bands in order. Within a band ties break on
cost, cheapest first, and the plan stops at `--max-fires`. A fire is
reserved at its historical cost: its cell's mean agent `cost_usd` per run
(summed over both arms) converted to allowance points by the ratio the
measured routine runs show (points per dollar), between `per_run_overrun`
and one full reservation; one full reservation when either is unknown. A
bare fire runs ONE arm, so it is reserved at its cell's mean agent cost per
arm trial times `BARE_TRIALS`, clamped the same way. An
improve or guidance-improve fire is reserved at
`allowance_guard.improve_charge`. The room is
`allowance_guard.room`. The per-fire guard still checks every fire at its
full reservation before it spends anything; this plan only orders them.

IMPROVE ELIGIBILITY (rule A), per skill with fixtures under evals/<skill>/:

  1. at least `MIN_IMPROVE_FIXTURES` (4) fixtures, all naming
     adam-agentskills (the one registry the routine checks out); the first
     by name is the fixed holdout, passed as `holdout` so the proposer never
     sees it. Fewer fixtures with train headroom is a `needs-fixtures` work
     item instead, ranked by headroom.
  2. train headroom: 1 - the pooled with-arm pass rate over the other
     fixtures is at least `MIN_GAIN` (propose_skill_edit's default gain). A
     skill below it (one that already passes at least 90% of its checks) can
     not be improved by an edit, so it becomes a `needs-harder-fixtures` work
     item instead: the next step is a fixture it fails. Retiring skills and
     skills outside adam-agentskills get none.
  3. a target: some train check fails in at least 25% of at least 6 scored
     with-arm trials, at least twice, and has passed at least once in some
     arm. Infrastructure trials are not evidence (gates.trial_record).
  4. not owned by retirement: its verdict is not `retire` or
     `retire-pending`.
  5. not paused (rule C, `pause`): no open improve pull request
     (`eval-improve/<skill>` in adam-agentskills), no attempt in flight, no
     open issue or pull request labeled `on-hold` whose title names the
     skill, no cooldown. Outcomes come from scripts/improve_outcomes.py.

  The same ranking covers every guidance section with fixtures (not
  `_delivery`, the canary), found by scripts/propose_guidance_edit.py's own
  listing (fixtures declaring the `full` ablation arm). A section is
  eligible with at least `MIN_IMPROVE_FIXTURES` such fixtures (the last in
  name order is the holdout, as the proposer picks it), train headroom of at
  least `MIN_GAIN` over its pooled in-situ `full` arm runs, and a guidance
  verdict (the verdict document's `guidance` half) that is not `retire` or
  `retire-pending`, an `eval-coverage.yml` row that is not `skipped` (the
  proposer refuses one), and not paused: `pause` keyed by section over the
  guidance-improve outcomes (scripts/improve_outcomes.py, mode
  `guidance-improve`) and the `eval-guidance-improve/<section>` pull
  requests in _agent-guidance, plus the guidance lane (`guidance_lane`): no
  guidance-loop pull request (`eval-guidance-improve/*`,
  `retire-guidance/*`) open there and no guidance-improve attempt in flight,
  since every guidance edit writes AGENTS.md and docs/guidance-impact.md and
  a second would conflict. Its content change, for the three-rejection stop,
  is the _agent-guidance history of its row's file. It has no target rule
  (the proposer proposes before it measures). An eligible section is an
  improve-band fire, `mode: guidance-improve`, its `section`, the proposer's
  holdout as `holdout` (the fixture key, guidance/<section>/<name>), reserved
  at the improve charge; at most ONE per plan, the highest value (the lane
  rule again). The work item `guidance-improve` (change type
  `guidance-edit`, routed to a local run of the proposer) remains only for
  an eligible section whose id the fire workflow's `section` pattern
  (^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$) refuses. One with fewer fixtures and headroom
  gets `needs-fixtures`, one without headroom `needs-harder-fixtures`, each
  carrying its `section`.

STOPPING (rule C): a rejection (every no-branch outcome, conservatively, and
an accepted candidate whose pull request closed unmerged) starts a 14-day
cooldown; three in a row stop the skill until its content (the registry
checkout's git history for its directory), a fixture (this repository's
history under evals/<skill>/) or the roster (evals/roster.yml) changes after
the third, or 90 days pass. A failed fire job is infrastructure: it is
retried at most twice, then the skill waits 14 days. After a merged
improvement nothing is attempted until a with-arm run of the new content
lands (the gates pool only runs of the content on main).

WORK ITEMS are not fires: `needs-fixtures`, `needs-harder-fixtures` and
`fixture-broken` (change type
`fixture`), `guidance-improve` (change type `guidance-edit`; only for a
section id the fire workflow refuses, see above), and `agent-check` items
read from `--lessons` (lesson proposals
of kind `agent-check`, adam-agentskills-private lessons/proposals/**.json),
which go to the fleet worker as agent-ready issues (Adam, 2026-10-26: git
hooks are the first choice whenever possible, so they lead the work list).
Every item carries `change_type`: `skill-edit` for an improve fire,
`guidance-edit` for a guidance-improve fire, `fixture`, `agent-check`, or
`trigger`.

THE TRIGGER LANE (usage tracking, 2026-10-26: about 55 skill calls in 8
weeks over about 72,000 model turns, so most skills almost never trigger).
Every adam-agentskills skill whose usage weight is fresh (known) and at most
`TRIGGER_MAX_WEIGHT` gets a work item: `trigger-optimize` (change type
`trigger`) when it has a reviewed evals/<skill>/trigger-eval-set.json, or
`needs-trigger-set` (change type `fixture`) to write one. Neither is a
fire: improve mode's payload cannot ask for description optimization with
that set, so a trigger item is routed "needs routine prompt change"
(docs/how-it-works.md, "The trigger lane"). Trigger items sit just before
the improve work items. Skills whose SKILL.md is mostly checklist or rules
sections (`hook_candidate`) are listed as `hook_candidates` and in the
summary, since a git hook may serve them better.

OUTPUT. `--out` gets the whole plan as JSON, including `improve_ranking`
(every candidate, skill or guidance section, by value, highest first and
unknown last, with its use, headroom, cost, whether use and cost were known,
and eligibility) and `guidance` (a per-section status like `skills`); each
fire entry carries its `value` (null for an eval fire; the matrix legs do
not). `--ranking-out` gets the ranking alone (public-safe: skill names and
section ids), which the weekly workflow uploads as the `improve-ranking`
artifact. $GITHUB_OUTPUT gets `matrix=`
(the fires, improve and guidance-improve fires last so a long improve run
never holds up the evals behind it; every leg carries `section`, empty but
for a guidance-improve leg) and `count=`. The log and job summary carry numbers and
public skill names only: agent-check items are counted, never quoted.

FIRE CHECK. `guidance-headroom SECTION` is routine-eval-fire.yml's check
before a guidance-improve fire: the same rule A headroom over the same
pooled in-situ `full` runs (`guidance_contexts`), so a fire dispatched by
hand cannot start what the plan would never pick. Exit 1 when the train
headroom is known and under `MIN_GAIN` (the section already passes at least
90% of its checks; it needs harder fixtures), 0 otherwise. Unknown headroom
passes: the guidance proposer measures before it decides, and the rule is
about sections already at the ceiling. Unlike the skill proposer it has no
early stop after a baseline (it interleaves baseline and candidate), so
without this check such a fire spends its whole run before rejecting
(2026-10-28: "anything-you-name-gets-its-link" at 72/72, run
20261028T213124Z-65c174). The log names the section and the numbers only.

EVIDENCE. `--evidence FILE` reads the GitHub evidence from a recorded JSON
file ({fire_runs, improve_branches, registry_prs, on_hold}, and optionally
guidance_branches, guidance_prs and guidance_on_hold, empty when absent);
without it the evidence is fetched with GH_TOKEN (scripts/improve_outcomes.py's
reader), _agent-guidance's pull requests and on-hold issues included.
Every read failure stops the plan (fail closed); the message is fixed text
and a status code.
