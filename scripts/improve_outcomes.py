"""Improve outcomes, derived from evidence that already exists (G5).

The thresholds' stopping rules (rule C: a cooldown after a rejection, a stop
after three in a row) need a record of every improve attempt. The routine's
improve mode pushes nothing on a rejection (ADR 0005), and its saved prompt
may only change with Adam's OK, so this module derives each outcome from
what GitHub already holds:

  * THE ATTEMPT: a run of routine-eval-fire.yml whose title is
    `Fire eval routine: improve <skill>` (the workflow's `run-name`, which is
    what makes a dispatch's mode and skill readable from the runs API). A
    fire run that concluded `success` started a routine session; any other
    conclusion is `fire-failed`: refused before any spend (the allowance
    guard, the fixture check) or broken, so infrastructure, never a measured
    rejection.
  * ACCEPTED: a `claude/eval-improve-<run id>` branch in skills-evals whose
    run id's timestamp falls inside that fire run's span (the fire workflow
    stamps the run id in its validate step, between the run's start and its
    last update), and whose `summary.json` names the same skill when it
    could be read. The routine pushes the branch on an accepted candidate
    only.
  * REJECTED: no such branch `OUTCOME_WINDOW` after the fire. That is a
    measured rejection, a refusal or a run that never finished; the evidence
    cannot tell them apart, so every one counts toward the cooldown and the
    stop rule, the conservative direction.
  * PENDING: younger than that, with no branch yet.

A guidance section's improve run (routine-eval-fire.yml's `guidance-improve`
mode, ADR 0005's routine guidance improve mode addendum) is derived the same
way, keyed by `section` instead of `skill`: its title is `Fire eval routine:
guidance-improve <section>` and an accepted candidate is a
`claude/eval-guidance-improve-<run id>` branch whose `summary.json` names the
section. `KINDS` holds the two shapes; every function below takes `mode`,
`improve` by default, so a caller that names none reads skills only.

`outcomes` is pure: tests pass recorded API rows and `now`. The fetchers
below it make the only network calls (GitHub REST, `GH_TOKEN`), page with a
fixed cap and raise `EvidenceError` with at most a status code, never a
response body.
