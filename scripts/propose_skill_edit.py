"""Propose one SKILL.md edit, measure it against held-out fixtures, keep the record.

Part of https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/skills-evals/issues/71 (the smallest
slice) and https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/skills-evals/issues/232. The
decision record is docs/decisions/0005-improvement-loop-reuses-skill-creator.md.

    python3 scripts/propose_skill_edit.py <skill> \\
        --registry adam-agentskills=PATH [--ref REF] [--trials 3] \\
        [--rotation K] [--min-gain .10] [--holdout FIXTURE] \\
        [--trigger-eval-set FILE] [--skill-creator DIR] [--num-workers 1] \\
        [--results-dir DIR] [--no-judge] [--dry-run]

WHAT IT DOES, in order:

 1. Refuses (exit 2, "needs more fixtures") a skill with fewer than three
    nested fixtures under `evals/<skill>/`: one held-out fixture beside one
    train fixture is a coin toss, not a split.
 2. Splits them deterministically: the fixtures in name order, validation is
    the one at index `rotation % n`, train is the rest. `rotation` defaults to
    the number of records already written for this skill, so consecutive
    runs hold out a different fixture. `--holdout` removes one fixed fixture
    from both train and the rotating validation population on every run.
 3. Builds two scratch registries from `git archive <ref>` of the local
    registry checkout: no `.git`, so nothing in them has a push path.
 4. BASELINE: `scripts/local_eval.py evals/<skill> --arm with_skill --trials N`
    against the first scratch copy.
 5. TRIGGER HALF, from Anthropic's skill-creator plugin: its
    `scripts/run_loop.py` description-optimization loop (stratified 60/40
    train/held-out split of a should/should-not-trigger query set, 3 runs per
    query, best description picked by HELD-OUT score). The validation
    fixture's prompt and the fixed holdout's prompt are never in that set,
    and a query appears in it once. A fixture-derived set whose train or
    held-out split (by skill-creator's own split arithmetic) lacks a
    should-trigger or should-not-trigger query is refused before any model
    call, with a `trigger-set-unusable` record; a reviewed
    `--trigger-eval-set` is run anyway and its split problems recorded.
    A reviewed set lives beside the skill's fixtures as
    `evals/<skill>/trigger-eval-set.json` (writing-adrs ships one) and is
    passed explicitly; it must be a JSON list of exactly
    `{query: string, should_trigger: boolean}` objects.
    `--num-workers` must be 1 (the default): skill-creator's parallel
    workers share one project directory and undercount triggers.
    Scratch project settings disable the archived registry plugins that
    provide the skill, leaving the operator's login available.
 6. BODY HALF: one proposal call (roster judge model, no tools) returning
    `{rationale, unified_diff}` for SKILL.md's body, fed the train fixtures'
    failed checks and transcripts. A diff naming any other file, or touching
    the frontmatter, is rejected before anything else runs.
 7. CANDIDATE: both halves applied to the second scratch copy and measured
    through the same local_eval invocation.
 8. ACCEPT only if validation held (objective pass rate not lower; judge mean
    not lower by more than 0.5) AND train improved (objective pass rate
    higher by at least `--min-gain` (default .10), or equal with judge mean
    higher by at least ten times that gain). A fixed holdout must not regress
    on either score. This is a conservative heuristic, not a significance test.
 9. Writes `<results>/improvements/<skill>/<ts>.json` always, `<ts>.patch`
    whenever a candidate existed, and `<ts>.pr-body.md` on accept. Nothing is
    pushed and no pull request is opened: a human reads the record first.

`--dry-run` prints the plan and makes no model call and no write.

EVERY MODEL CALL GOES THROUGH A `Runner` (the three methods below), so the
tests drive the whole pipeline offline with a fake. This is a LOCAL exhibit
under ADR 0002 decision 4: it runs under the operator's own login, its numbers
are not badge input, and it never runs in CI.

Exit codes: 0 accepted, 1 rejected (or nothing to measure), 2 refused or
errored before a decision could be taken.
