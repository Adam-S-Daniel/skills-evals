"""Validate a routine's `claude/eval-guidance-improve-<run id>` branch and
open its pull request in Adam-S-Daniel/_agent-guidance.

The guidance analog of scripts/improve_gate.py (ADR 0005, "Routine guidance
improve mode addendum"). In `guidance-improve` mode the eval routine runs
`scripts/propose_guidance_edit.py` on one section and, when its candidate is
ACCEPTED (exit 0: accepted and the patch passed _agent-guidance's own checks),
pushes one branch holding exactly

    eval-guidance-improve/<run id>/summary.json    the record (`<ts>.json`)
    eval-guidance-improve/<run id>/report.md       its PR body (`<ts>.pr-body.md`)
    eval-guidance-improve/<run id>/guidance.patch  its patch (`<ts>.patch`)

and nothing else. It never opens a pull request. The branch is UNTRUSTED
input (a model run wrote it): `.github/workflows/routine-guidance-improve-gate.yml`
runs this script from the default branch's checkout, and it reads the branch
only through git plumbing, reusing ingest_routine_results.py's and
improve_gate.py's helpers. Nothing from the branch is executed, imported or
checked out; `prepare` hands the validated patch to `git apply` in an
_agent-guidance checkout, as data.

`eval-guidance-improve/` is its own root: `claude/eval-guidance-improve-*`
also matches the results signal's `claude/eval-*` branch filter, and only the
path filters (`eval-results/**`, `eval-improve/**`, this root) keep each push
to its own gate.

What a branch must look like to pass `validate`:

  * its name is `claude/eval-guidance-improve-<YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>-<6 hex>`;
  * against its merge-base with the default branch it ADDS exactly the three
    files above, regular and non-executable, under its own run id;
  * summary.json is an `accepted` record (schema 1, exit code 0, patch
    validation ok) for one section id (`SECTION_RE`), at a full guidance
    commit sha, whose row file is `agents-md/base.md` or
    `agents-md/sections/<name>.md` and not a skipped row, and whose split
    names exactly the section's fixtures on the default branch
    (propose_guidance_edit's own listing);
  * guidance.patch is a `git diff` of the row's file and, optionally,
    `agents-md/eval-coverage.yml`, `docs/guidance-impact.md` and `AGENTS.md`
    (what the proposer's `build_patch` writes), each at most once, every
    hunk's line counts agreeing with its header, and the row's file among
    them;
  * report.md opens with the proposer's own title for that section and holds
    no closing keyword or @mention;
  * every file is under its size cap and valid UTF-8 with no control
    characters.

`prepare` builds the _agent-guidance commit on a clean checkout of its default
branch tip, holding no credential: it refuses unless the measured sha is an
ancestor of the tip and `agents-md/` and `AGENTS.md` are unchanged between the
two (what merges is what was measured), and the tip's manifest row is the
record's; it applies the patch, re-copies `agents-md/base.md` to
`.claude/hooks/fleet-guidance.md` when base.md changed (that repository's
byte-identical fleet-memory payload), checks WHAT changed (`check_content`:
nothing of the section's file outside the section's extent, no new `##`
heading, only the row's `bytes` in the manifest, one inserted impact entry
for the section; AGENTS.md is left to that repository's own staleness
check, which regenerates it), and refuses any changed path outside
repo-settings ADR 0014's allowlist for _agent-guidance: `agents-md/**`,
`AGENTS.md`, `docs/guidance-impact.md`, and `.claude/hooks/fleet-guidance.md`
only as a byte-identical copy of `agents-md/base.md`. The merge mode is
`evals/improve-policy.yml`'s `improve_merge_mode` (improve_gate.merge_mode):
there is no plugin runtime in _agent-guidance to lower it.

`open-pr` writes, with the eval-improve App's token minted for
_agent-guidance alone (`GUIDANCE_TOKEN`; repo-settings ADR 0014). With no
token it opens nothing and says why, exit 0: a missing secret or a failed
mint is not a gate failure. Otherwise, unless the target branch
`eval-guidance-improve/<section>` already exists or any guidance-loop pull
request (`eval-guidance-improve/*`, `retire-guidance/*`) is open there (they
all write `AGENTS.md` and `docs/guidance-impact.md`, so a second one would
conflict), it pushes the commit (verified with `git merge-base
--is-ancestor`), opens the pull request (a draft unless the mode is `auto`),
labels it `agent-authored`, and in `auto` mode enables auto-merge by merge
commit with `--match-head-commit` and reads it back. Every GitHub call goes
through an injectable `gh(args, stdin)` and the push through `push(tree,
branch)`, so the tests need no network.

`fire-check` is routine-eval-fire.yml's offline check before the bearer
exists: the section id's shape, at least propose_guidance_edit's
`MIN_FIXTURES` fixtures declaring the `full` arm (its `fixture_layout_discover`),
a holdout empty or one of them, and, with `--guidance DIR`, a manifest row that
is not skipped (its `load_row`).

Subcommands (output is `key=value` lines of validated values, for
$GITHUB_OUTPUT):
