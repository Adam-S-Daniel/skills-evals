"""Mine merged fleet pull requests into real-work fixture candidates.

Part of https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/skills-evals/issues/65 and
https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/skills-evals/issues/98 (DESIGN.md "Real-work
fixtures from merged pull requests"). READ-ONLY: it calls only `gh api` REST
reads and `git archive`, writes only the `--out` path, and refuses an `--out`
inside this repository. No GraphQL: a Claude Code cloud session, where the
eval routine runs it, answers every GitHub GraphQL request with HTTP 403, and
`gh repo view`, `gh pr list` and `gh pr diff` all go through GraphQL.

    python3 scripts/mine_real_work.py mine \\
        --registry PATH/_agent-guidance/repos.yml --out /tmp/candidates.json \\
        [--sync-workflow PATH/_agent-guidance/.github/workflows/sync.yml] \\
        [--limit 2000]

    python3 scripts/mine_real_work.py prepare --clone PATH --base SHA \\
        --merge SHA --test-file PATH ... --out /tmp/rg/<repo>-<pr>

    python3 scripts/mine_real_work.py admit --candidates /tmp/candidates.json \\
        --results /tmp/rg --out /tmp/admitted.json [--cap-seconds 60]

MINE. The fleet is `cron_coverage.fleet` in `_agent-guidance`'s `repos.yml`,
never a search. That list holds bare names; the owners are `SYNC_OWNERS` in
the sibling `sync.yml`, read by parsing the YAML. Every name is resolved
under EVERY owner (`GET /repos/{owner}/{name}`), and a name no owner resolves is an error:
the denominator must not shrink silently. A name that resolves to the same
repository under two owners (a rename redirect) counts once. Only PUBLIC
repositories are mined (owner decision Q3); a private one is listed under
`skipped`. Bot pull requests (head ref or author) and `on-hold` ones are
excluded. A candidate is a merged pull request that changes a test file and
a non-test, non-doc file, and whose body (the task text, Q3) is non-empty.
`--limit` counts merged pull requests, newest created first. `closing_issues`
is what the body's closing keywords name in this repository (`closing_refs`),
kept only when GitHub reads the number back as an issue and only for a pull
request into the default branch: REST has no `closingIssuesReferences`, so an
issue linked only by hand in the sidebar is not seen.
Each candidate records its merge date (Q8: pre/post training-cutoff fixtures
are reported apart, not excluded), its base and an `answer_leak` flag: the
body quotes a line the pull request added. The base is a true merge's first
parent, else (squash or rebase merge) the PR's `base.sha`, which can predate
the base branch at merge time; `base_from` says which. A repo whose pull
requests 404, a PR with no readable merge commit, or a PR whose diff GitHub will
not render (HTTP 406, over its line or file cap; counted as `diff_too_large`) is
skipped with a warning naming repo#number; any other `gh` failure aborts.

PREPARE is the `redgreen.sh` tree step: `git archive` of base and merge into
`<out>/red` and `<out>/green`, with the merge's test files laid over `red`.
It runs nothing. Run the checker in each tree yourself, with no network,
writing JUnit XML to `<results>/<key>/red.xml` and `green.xml`, and the two
durations in seconds to `run.json` (`{"red_secs": .., "green_secs": ..,
"timed_out": false}`), where `<key>` is the candidate's `key`:

    unshare --user --map-current-user --net --pid --fork --mount-proc -- \\
        python3 -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider --junitxml=red.xml <tests>

ADMIT reads those results. FAIL_TO_PASS is every test that fails on red and
passes on green. A test that fails on green too, or whose red failure is a
missing package or the network, is ENVIRONMENTAL and is excluded (fixture 8,
_agent-guidance#82: `node_modules/yaml is missing`). A red failure that is a
missing name the fix invented (`is not a function`, `ImportError`,
`AttributeError`) is INTERFACE-COUPLED (fixture 4, cms-platform#430) and
rejects the candidate unless the task text names that interface. A candidate
is admitted only with FAIL_TO_PASS >= 1, no interface coupling and both runs
inside the cap (owner decision Q1: per-test selection under 60 s).
