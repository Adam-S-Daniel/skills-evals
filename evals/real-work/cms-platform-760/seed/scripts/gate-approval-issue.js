// Tell a human, in a place they will actually see, that a repo-settings apply
// is parked waiting for their approval — and take it back down the moment it
// is not.
//
// WHY. An `environment:` gate is invisible unless you are looking at the
// Actions tab. Nothing goes red, no PR blocks, no notification arrives that
// distinguishes "a run finished" from "a run is waiting for YOU". #313 is the
// eleven-day version of that: twelve consecutive runs concluded `cancelled`,
// one of them parked at an unapproved gate for ten days, and the alerting the
// repo already had could not see any of it. The classifier next door
// (repo-settings-write-risk.js) removes MOST approvals; this makes the ones
// that remain arrive somewhere.
//
// An issue, rather than a comment or a notification, for three reasons: it is
// assignable (so it reaches the reviewer's inbox), it is stateful (open means
// "still waiting", closed means "dealt with"), and it can be reconciled by a
// later run — so a request that was superseded, approved, rejected or reaped
// does not sit there lying about the present.
//
// LIFECYCLE — two writers, and the second is the backstop for the first:
//   `open`   the plan job, when the plan needs a human. Creates the issue, or
//            updates the existing one in place when a NEWER run supersedes it
//            (the apply job is newest-wins, so yesterday's request is dead the
//            moment today's exists — leaving both open would be two asks for
//            one decision).
//   `close`  (a) the job that runs after the gated apply resolves, whatever it
//            resolved to; and (b) the plan job of any later run that finds
//            nothing needing approval. (b) is what makes a lost (a) — a run
//            cancelled before its cleanup job could start — self-heal within a
//            day instead of leaving a permanent open lie.
//
// Both directions FAIL LOUD. A notifier that fails quietly is worse than no
// notifier: it converts "you were not told" into "you were told there was
// nothing to tell". The exit code is the alarm.
//
// PUBLIC-LOG RULE: this writes into a PUBLIC repo's issues. It emits the plan
