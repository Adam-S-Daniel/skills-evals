/*
 * check-pin-agreement — assert that a workflow which names a version TWICE
 * names the SAME version both times.
 *
 * ── THE DEFECT (#283) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A caller of a cms-platform reusable carries the platform version twice:
 *
 *     jobs:
 *       audit:
 *         uses: Adam-S-Daniel/cms-platform/.github/workflows/<x>.yml@v0.1.87
 *         with:
 *           platform_ref: v0.1.87
 *
 * Dependabot's `github-actions` ecosystem moves the FIRST (it is a dependency
 * ref) and structurally CANNOT move the SECOND (it is a `with:` input value).
 * That is not speculative — one release produced fifteen piecemeal `uses:@`
 * bump PRs on one consumer, which is why the fleet's Dependabot `ignore` for
 * cms-platform refs exists at all.
 *
 * The resulting skew is worse than a crash. A half-bumped caller runs the NEW
 * reusable against the OLD script the stale `platform_ref` sparse-checks out,
 * and an argv-scanning `flag()` silently ignores a flag it does not know. So
 * the job goes GREEN, reports on the lanes the old script did know about, and
 * performs zero detection on the one the new workflow asked for — with nothing
 * anywhere saying so. Measured live: seven fleet repos sat a release behind on
 * exactly this pair while one of them accumulated fourteen unreported failing
 * default-branch push runs.
 *
 * ── THE RULE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Any mapping that carries BOTH a `uses:` with an `@<ref>` AND a
 * `with.platform_ref` must have the two refs EQUAL. That is the whole check.
 *
 * It is deliberately IDENTITY-FREE: no repo slug, no canonical version, no
 * lockfile, no manifest. It compares a file against ITSELF. That is what makes
 * it adoptable by a fleet repo that has no `platform.lock`, no theme gem and no
 * pin-consistency gate — the repos where this skew is currently unguarded.
 * A job-level `uses:` is always a reusable WORKFLOW (steps, not jobs, name
 * actions), and a `platform_ref` input only means anything to a platform
 * reusable, so the pairing is unambiguous and needs no configuration to
 * disambiguate. Step-level mappings are walked the same way at no extra cost.
 *
 * ── IT PARSES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * GitHub enabled YAML anchors in workflows on 2025-09-18, so `&anchor` /
 * `*alias` are legal here and a `uses:` or a `platform_ref:` can be an ALIAS
 * whose value is written somewhere else entirely. A regex or a line scan reads
 * such a file as clean because it cannot see the value at all. So this walks
 * the parsed document, with `merge: true` so a `<<:` merge key resolves too —
 * otherwise `<<` survives as a literal own key and a job assembled that way
 * looks to every structural check like a job with no `uses:` and no `with:`.
 *
 * Findings are located by KEY PATH (`jobs.audit`, `jobs.x.steps[2]`), not by
 * line number, and that is a consequence of parsing rather than a shortcut: an
 * aliased value's line is not the line the reader has to edit, so a line number
 * there would point at the wrong place. The key path is exact either way.
 *
 * ── CLI ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   node scripts/check-pin-agreement.js [--] [FILE_OR_DIR...]
 * With no argument it scans `.github/workflows` under the current directory.
 * Prints one `  FILE :: PATH: uses@REF != platform_ref REF` line per finding.
 * Exit codes are three-valued ON PURPOSE, because a caller has to tell "ran,
 * found skew" apart from "could not run":
 *   0  ran, every ref pair agrees (the pairs examined are reported)
 *   1  ran, skew found (each finding printed)
 *   2  could not run — bad usage, unreadable/unparseable file, or a scan that
 *      examined ZERO workflow files. A lint that silently examines nothing
 *      looks exactly like a lint that found nothing wrong, and this one is
 *      adopted by repos where nobody is watching the output closely.
