/*
 * Shared Decap entry-editor UI interactions.
 *
 * Why this module exists (#1723 / PR #407):
 * The Published toggle and the Save → Ready → Publish flow were copy-
 * pasted into every CMS loop spec (cms-publish-loop-prod-mutate,
 * cms-unpublish-republish, cms-media-roundtrip, and the -preview
 * variants). Copies drift: one spec's cleanup leg still looked for the
 * Published widget as `getByRole("checkbox")` while the rest had moved to
 * `getByRole("switch")` (Decap renders it as a switch). That drift sat
 * latent until #1723's future-date fix let the prod-mutate cleanup run
 * for the first time — then it failed on the stale selector. Centralising
 * these interactions here (and lint-locking that specs don't hand-roll
 * them — see cms-editor-ui.test.js) keeps every caller in sync.
 *
 * Pure helpers over the caller's Playwright `page`; `expect` comes from
 * ./base so messages match the rest of the suite.

// Publish the entry's pending changes through the editor — STATE-ROBUST
// across the two editorial-workflow shapes:
//
//   - A fresh / not-yet-published entry sits in the Draft → In review →
//     Ready column and shows a `Status: Draft|In review` chip that must
//     be advanced to "Ready" before "Publish" is enabled.
//   - A re-edited ALREADY-PUBLISHED entry (e.g. a cleanup leg unpublishing
//     after the forward leg published) has no such chip — it exposes the
//     `Publish ▾` control directly.
//
// Gate the Ready step on the Draft chip's presence — and do NOT hard-
// assert a `Status: Ready` chip afterwards. In the published-re-edit
// state, advancing to Ready surfaces the `Publish ▾` control directly
// (no `Status: Ready` chip), so the old unconditional
// `expect(Status: Ready)` timed out there (#1723). `Publish.click()`
// already auto-waits for the control to be actionable, which is the
// real gate. Callers must Save first (use saveEntry) so the toolbar has
// settled before we read the chip.
// Publish the open entry THROUGH THE UI an editor actually uses — which is
// now TWO different UIs depending on the shell, and getting that wrong is a
// live regression a green unit-lint lane cannot see.
//
// ── Why this branches (cms-platform v0.1.97) ───────────────────────────
// The PRODUCTION shell ships the publishing-UX phase 2 + 3 shims
// (docs/PUBLISHING-UX.md): `one-door-publish.js` CSS-hides Decap's Status
// dropdown, and `publish-button.js` CSS-hides Decap's split Publish control
// and renders `#cms-publish-button` in its place, with an inline "Yes,
// publish" confirmation instead of a dropdown menu item.
//
// The old body of this function did `getByRole("button", {name: /^Publish$/i})`
// then `getByRole("menuitem", {name: /publish now/i})`. On the new shell the
// FIRST of those still resolves — to the platform's own button, because
// getByRole skips the CSS-hidden Decap one — so the click "succeeds", opens
// the inline confirmation, and then the menuitem lookup finds nothing. That
// is precisely how run 33439336337 failed: the entry was created and its PR
// opened, then the publish leg died about two minutes in.
//
// So: prefer the platform button when it is on screen, and keep the Decap
// path for every shell that has no replacement — `index-test.html` (the
// rehearsal surface, which deliberately keeps Decap's own controls) and
// `index-local.html` (no editorial workflow at all).
//
// The Status→Ready step is kept in the Decap branch only. On the production
// shell it is not merely unnecessary, it is the SECOND DOOR phase 2 closed:
// setting Ready applies `decap-cms/pending_publish`, which
// `auto-merge-when-ready` fires on. Driving it there would be the test
// exercising a route the product no longer offers.
//
// ── The wait is load-bearing ───────────────────────────────────────────
// `#cms-publish-button` only renders once `publish-progress.js` has FOUND
// the entry's `cms/<collection>/<slug>` pull request, which is one poll
// after Save. Without a wait this races the poller and falls through to the
// Decap branch on the very shell where Decap's control is hidden — the
// original bug, in a new costume. PUBLISH_BUTTON_TIMEOUT_MS covers a poll
// interval plus GitHub latency with room to spare.
const PUBLISH_BUTTON_TIMEOUT_MS = 90_000;

// and RETURNS WITHOUT THROWING on (a) a stale/missing PR number or Decap
// token, or (b) a non-2xx response arming the PR's `cms/ready` label — so a
// `publishViaUi` that only clicks the confirmation and returns cannot tell a
// real publish from either silent failure. A silent (a) on an entry UPDATE
// (the poller's last answer predated the PR) cost 34 minutes of an unrelated
// deploy-lane timeout before the real cause showed up at all (adamdaniel.ai
// run 33573287045, cms-platform#386). Kept as lowercase SUBSTRINGS of

//   simple mode (local backend)                      → "Delete entry" / "Delete new entry"
//
// History (#1771 follow-up, iterations 1–3): the ephemeral prod canaries
// originally published via the `cms/ready` label only (iter 1/2), NOT
// Decap's "Publish Now" — the external auto-merge landed the post on main
// while Decap's editor still held it as a brand-new editorial-workflow
// draft (isNewEntry=true, hasUnpublishedChanges=true). #1801 added
// publishViaUi (Status:Ready → Publish Now) to push the editor toward the
// PUBLISHED state. But the run-26529125192 failure proved publishViaUi
// alone is NOT enough: "Publish Now" hits branch protection (checks
// pending), so admin/publish-via-auto-merge.js catches the 422, labels
// `cms/ready`, and hands Decap a SYNTHETIC `merged:true`. The PR then
// auto-merges for REAL only ~5–15 min later. In the gap, the
// `cms/posts/<slug>` editorial branch still exists, so when the delete leg
// re-navigates to the entry Decap's loadUnpublishedEntry (the
// editorial-workflow loadEntry override, withWorkflow.js) re-loads it as an
// OPEN draft (currentStatus set, hasUnpublishedChanges=true). EditorToolbar
// then wires Delete to onDeleteUnpublishedChanges (line 654), which drops
// only the draft branch — never main — so no delete-from-main PR opens and
// the URL never 404s. The iteration-3 fix (this follow-up) is
// reopenForPublishedDelete() below: the specs first wait for the create PR
// to MERGE for real, then poll-reload the editor until Decap drops the
// editorial entry and re-loads the published file ("Delete published
// entry", no Status chip), and only THEN click delete — so the click hits
// onDelete (delete from main).
//
// Match ALL five label variants anyway so the click is robust regardless of
// which editorial state Decap shows. The control is a real <button> (the styled

// write-up. Short version:
//
// In editorial_workflow mode Decap overrides loadEntry → loadUnpublishedEntry
// (withWorkflow.js). When you navigate to `#/collections/<col>/entries/<slug>`
// and the entry's `cms/<col>/<slug>` editorial branch STILL EXISTS — which
// it does between the synthetic `merged:true` the publish-via-auto-merge
// shim hands Decap and the REAL auto-merge landing ~5–15 min later —
// `retrieveUnpublishedEntryData` returns the open editorial entry, so the
// editor renders the DRAFT toolbar ("Status: Draft" + "Delete unpublished
// entry"). A Delete click there calls `onDeleteUnpublishedChanges` and
// removes only the draft branch; the file on main is untouched, no
// delete-from-main PR opens, and the URL never 404s (the exact run
// 26529125192 failure: post served, then the delete leg timed out with NO
// delete PR ever opened).
//
// The deterministic fix is to NOT click delete until Decap has re-loaded
// the entry as a plain PUBLISHED entry (no editorial branch ⇒ no
// `currentStatus` ⇒ "Delete published entry"). We poll-reload the editor
// until the editorial Status chip is GONE and the "Delete published entry"
// button is present. The caller is responsible for having first confirmed
// the create PR actually merged (the branch is what Decap keys off, and
// auto-merge with SQUASH closes+deletes it); this loop additionally
// tolerates the lag between merge and Decap's local-state catch-up by
// hard-reloading (which re-runs loadUnpublishedEntry against fresh
// backend state).
