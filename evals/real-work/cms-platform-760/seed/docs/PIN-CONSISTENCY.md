# Platform-pin consistency (anti-skew)

What this is: how `scripts/check-platform-pin-consistency.js` keeps every
place a consumer references the platform version — reusable `uses:@ref`
pins, composite `uses:@ref` pins, `Gemfile`/`Gemfile.lock`
`tag:`, `platform.lock` `platform_ref`, and each caller's `platform_ref:`
input — in lockstep, plus the workflow-content (call-interface) parity check
that catches a thin caller whose body drifted from the canonical template.
Read this before changing the pin-consistency script, `platform-bump.yml`'s
seeding/retire/reconcile logic, or anything that adds a new "pin shape" a
consumer can carry.
See also the `platform-release-and-bump` skill and `docs/SYNC.md`'s
"Single-version pin invariant".

## Single-version pin consistency guard (anti-skew, #29)

A consumer references the platform version in MANY places (every reusable
`uses: …/.github/workflows/<n>.yml@<ref>`, every cross-repo composite
`uses: …/.github/actions/<n>@<ref>`, the `Gemfile`/`Gemfile.lock`
`tag:`, and `platform.lock` `platform_ref`). Historically Dependabot + `platform-bump`
landed bumps PIECEMEAL, so consumers drifted (observed live: adamdaniel.ai pinned
`@v0.1.0` loop/deploy callers, gem `@v0.1.5`, others `@v0.1.3`/`@v0.1.6` at once — a
`v0.1.0` reusable against a `v0.1.5` gem is a latent bug source). **As of #244 that
race is fully closed, on both halves.** #242 took the gem `tag:` out of it first —
Dependabot's `bundler` ecosystem `ignore`s `cms-platform-theme`, so `platform-bump`
is the gem's only bumper — and #244 did the same for every `uses:@` platform
ref: Dependabot's `github-actions` ecosystem now `ignore`s every
`Adam-S-Daniel/cms-platform/*` dependency name too (see `docs/SYNC.md` for the
evidence and the wildcard-matcher detail). **No Dependabot ecosystem bumps a
cms-platform reference anymore** — `platform-bump` is the single writer of the
platform version a consumer carries, which is what makes the single-version
invariant below structurally maintainable rather than a race this guard merely
catches after the fact. **`platform-bump.yml`
rewrites `.github/workflows/*` and pushes, so its credential MUST carry
`workflows: write`** or GitHub rejects the push (`refusing to allow … to update
workflow … without 'workflows' permission`) — the live half of #13. That
credential is the CMS automation App's per-run installation token when the
consumer has provisioned it, else the `CMS_PLATFORM_PAT` fine-grained PAT
(#238; the `consumer-repo-provisioning` skill has the provisioning steps).
It also seeds any workflow caller the release newly made platform-dictated —
copying the missing caller from `examples/site/.github/workflows/` at the new
ref, re-pinned to it — so the workflow-set-parity check (introduced v0.1.20,
#54) also passes on the bump PR alone. Observed live: v0.1.54 added
`dependabot-rearm-sweep.yml` and both consumers' bump PRs failed pin-consistency
with `workflow-set: MISSING (platform-dictated)` until hand-fixed.
It seeds a missing `oauth-proxy/deploy.sh` or `infrastructure/bootstrap/deploy.sh`
delegating wrapper the same way (#518): the scaffolder emits both, but a site
scaffolded before v0.1.29 never received them. Nothing checks for them, so
this is delivery only, never a red.

`scripts/check-platform-pin-consistency.js` (platform-owned, Node, needs only the
repo's `yaml` lib) makes them all agree:

- **Canonical version = `platform.lock` `platform_ref`** (source of truth; missing/
  unparseable → hard fail with a clear message).
- Parses every `.github/workflows/**/*.yml` with the **`yaml` parser** (anchors
  resolved — NOT regex); collects `uses:@` refs targeting the platform owner/repo
  (configurable via `--owner/--repo`, defaulting from `platform.lock`
  `platform_repo`). Reusable refs `.../workflows/*.yml@<ref>`: the `<ref>` must ==
  `platform_ref`. Composite refs `.../actions/*@<ref>`: **the same rule** — the
  `<ref>` is a TAG and must == `platform_ref`.

  A composite used to be the exception: SHA-pinned, with its version carried in a
  trailing `# vX.Y.Z` COMMENT read by a LINE-AWARE pass (the one justified
  regex/line exception to "parse, don't scan"). That comment went with the
  2026-08-20 fleet-wide retirement of the action pin comment — it drifted
  silently and then actively lied, and Dependabot rewrote it inconsistently. The
  tag ties a composite to `platform.lock`'s `platform_ref` DIRECTLY and is
  auditable without parsing a comment, so the checker now reads no comments at
  all and reusables and composites obey one rule. The tag carve-out in AGENTS.md
  ("a reusable *workflow* from a repo this account owns stays on a tag") extends
  to these composites for exactly that reason; nothing third-party is ever a
  tag.
- **Checks the `platform_ref:` INPUT each caller passes (#220).** The reusable's
  platform checkout does `ref: ${{ inputs.platform_ref }}`, so this value — not
  the `uses:@` pin — decides WHICH platform tree the job actually runs. It is
  canonical by definition, **not** a site-specific `with:` value, which is
  precisely why the workflow-CONTENT parity check below (it deliberately MASKS
  `with:` VALUES) is blind to it: the one value that selects the platform tree
  was the one thing the anti-skew guard didn't check. A `platform_ref` Pair
  whose value is a MAP is an input DECLARATION, not a pin
  (`platform_ref: { type: string, default: main }` in the reusables) and is
  skipped; so is a `${{ … }}` expression (a forwarded parameter, not statically
  resolvable).
- Reads `Gemfile` (`gem "cms-platform-theme", …, tag:`) + `Gemfile.lock` (the
  cms-platform GIT-source `tag:`); both must == `platform_ref`. Tolerates a
  consumer with NO Gemfile; ignores non-cms-platform `uses:`.
- **Aggregates ALL** violations (doesn't stop at first); prints a precise per-file
  report (file + found + expected) + `::error file=` annotations under
  `GITHUB_ACTIONS`. Exit non-zero iff any mismatch; exit 0 + OK summary otherwise.

Reusable + thin caller: `.github/workflows/platform-pin-consistency.yml`
(`workflow_call`; it was modelled on the since-deleted `platform-drift-guard`'s
checkout-consumer + checkout-platform-at-`platform_ref`-into-`.cms-platform/` +
run-platform-script shape; the reusable `npm install --no-save yaml` before
running, since the script resolves `yaml` from cwd/node_modules) +
`examples/site/.github/workflows/...`
(`pull_request`, NO `paths:` filter — any pin-bearing file can skew). Self-test:
`e2e/check-platform-pin-consistency.test.js` (`@lane local`, runs in
node-unit-lints) — consistent fixture → 0; skewed fixture → non-zero, each
offending file/value named. It **used to be described as complementing**
`platform-drift-guard` (that one guarded file CONTENT byte-match; this one
guards VERSION CONSISTENCY) — but that guard was **deleted in v0.1.83** along
with the transport that vendored the files it compared, so since then this is
the only cross-repo guard left. See `docs/SYNC.md` "Single-version pin
invariant".

The same guard also enforces **workflow-content (call-interface) parity**
(companion to the workflow-SET parity): a consumer's thin caller must match the
canonical `examples/site` template's CALL INTERFACE — each job's `uses` target +
`with` KEY-set + `secrets:` map + permissions — modulo version refs, site-specific
`with` VALUES, and deliberately site-tuned `on:` triggers (all
normalized/masked/excluded). The version-pin checks compare only the `@ref`
STRINGS, so they were BLIND to a caller whose BODY drifted — e.g. jodidaniel's
sweep caller silently dropped the now-required `secrets: CMS_E2E_PAT:` map and
`startup_failure`'d the reusable for weeks. `checkWorkflowContentParity()` parses
both callers (comments/formatting drop out), compares the call interface, and
flags the exact drifting facet. It does NOT fight a legit site difference (e.g.
adamdaniel TRIMS the host-loop push `paths:` to dodge prod-loop co-arrival
eviction #1892 — an `on:` change, excluded).

### `platform-bump` reconciles `secrets:` maps in the bump commit

Because the canonical template is read at the consumer's OWN `platform_ref`, a
release that changes a caller's `secrets:` map fails `workflow-content: DRIFT`
on the bump PR itself — v0.1.113 (#467) added `app_private_key` to the
`dependabot-rearm-sweep` template, and both v0.1.114 bump PRs
(adamdaniel.ai#3891, jodidaniel.com#281) failed until the map was hand-added.
`platform-bump` now runs `scripts/reconcile-caller-secrets.js` at the new ref
over every caller the consumer already has, in the same commit as the pin
rewrite:

- drift is decided with this checker's own `structuralShape()`, so
  "reconciled" means exactly "this guard agrees";
- keys the template gained are added (with the template's comments), keys it
  dropped are removed, changed values take the template's; a map the template
  no longer has is deleted, and `secrets: inherit` or a flow map is replaced
  by the template's block;
- the write is a splice of the `secrets:` lines only (re-serializing the
  parsed document would reformat most callers), so the consumer's comments
  and formatting elsewhere survive; the result is re-parsed and must match the
  template's map and leave everything else unchanged, or the file is left
  alone and reported `MANUAL`.

A `MANUAL` result (a flow-style job, an anchored or aliased map) or a skipped
pass (inputs unreadable at the new ref) puts a `:warning:` in the bump PR body;
this guard still catches the stale map, so fix it by hand in that PR. Tests:
`e2e/platform-bump-secrets-reconcile.test.js`, which runs the reconciler
against a synthetic consumer and then this checker over the result.

### Two opt-in `with:` keys are exempt from the key-set compare (media archive)

`checkWorkflowContentParity()`'s `withKeys` compare is an EXACT sorted-set
match, and the canonical `examples/site` template ships two inputs
COMMENTED OUT because adopting them is a per-site decision, not something
every consumer should default into: `deploy-preview.yml`'s
`media_archive_bucket` and `deploy-production.yml`'s `media_archive_bucket` +
`platform_ref` (the private media-PDF archive, `docs/MEDIA-ARCHIVE.md`). A
commented-out line drops out of the YAML parse entirely, so a consumer that
follows the docs and uncomments them gains a `with:` key the canonical set
doesn't have — and used to report `workflow-content: DRIFT`, making the
documented opt-in unshippable by any consumer at all (jodidaniel.com had to
revert its wiring — commit 07e5c4b).

`OPTIONAL_WITH_KEYS` in `scripts/check-platform-pin-consistency.js` fixes
that: a small, hand-maintained map from basename to the keys that basename's
canonical template ships commented out. `structuralShape()` strips those keys
from BOTH sides (canonical and consumer) before building `withKeys`, so
adopting the archive no longer drifts. It is a deliberately REVIEWED list, not
"any key commented out in the example" — deriving it from the comment text
would let a stale `#`-prefixed line (a debugging aid, a half-finished
feature) silently retire a real guard for every consumer at once.

Exempting `platform_ref` from the compare on `deploy-production.yml` removed
the only thing that forced it to be present alongside `media_archive_bucket`,
so `checkOptionalInputPairing()` re-asserts that pairing directly: any job in
a consumer's `deploy-production.yml` that sets a non-empty
`media_archive_bucket` must also set `platform_ref`. The reusable's
`platform_ref` input defaults to `main` — not a pin — and the
`media_archive_bucket != ''` steps check the platform out at `platform_ref`
to run `publish-opted-in-pdfs.sh`, so the unpaired shape would publish PDFs
to the live site from an unpinned `main` checkout. `deploy-preview.yml`
already passes `platform_ref` unconditionally (it isn't in that basename's
optional list), so it needs no equivalent pairing check.

### How a stale `platform_ref` INPUT got there, and why the seeder had to change (#220)

The live instance was not a hand-edit. `platform-bump.yml`'s **seeding** path
(the workflow-SET-parity feature, v0.1.20/#54) copies a newly-dictated caller
from `examples/site/.github/workflows/` and re-pins it — but it stamped only the
`uses:@` pin and the composite ref (then a SHA plus a `# vX.Y.Z` comment),
because those were "the ref shapes the pin-consistency checker recognizes." So
jodidaniel.com's
`cms-scheduled-publish-loop.yml`, seeded by the v0.1.62 bump, landed with
`uses:@v0.1.62` **and the example template's own `platform_ref: v0.1.59`**. Every
later bump's `CUR`->`LATEST` rewrite (then a global literal replace, since
replaced by `scripts/rewrite-platform-pins.js`, which likewise moves only a pin
whose ref equals `CUR`) could never repair it — `CUR`
is the CONSUMER's previous ref, which `v0.1.59` never matched again — so the
input froze for 14 releases while the `uses:` line tracked every bump. At v0.1.70
the checkout it selected (a v0.1.59 tree) predated the
`install-playwright-browsers` composite and the job died on `Can't find
'action.yml'`, silently, on a scheduled workflow. The seeder now stamps
`platform_ref:` too (bare / `"quoted"` / `'quoted'`), so the guard and the seeder
recognize the same three shapes. **Note the loop this closes:** the seeder's
shape list was justified by the checker's shape list, so the checker's blind spot
propagated into the seeder — keep the two in lockstep, in both directions.

### A bump PR cut in the same minute as another `main` merge carries a stale tree (v0.1.81)

`platform-bump` branches off `main` at the moment it runs. Dispatch it seconds
after a release while another PR is mid-merge and the bump branch is cut from
the *pre-merge* `main` — so it silently omits whatever that PR changed. Two
symptoms, in increasing order of nastiness:

1. **`update-branch` returns `422 merge conflict between base and head`** when
   the other PR touched a line the bump also rewrites. Annoying but loud.
2. **The bump PR tests the wrong tree.** If the release being adopted adds a
   CHECK that reads a file the other PR fixed, that check runs on the bump PR
   against the unfixed content and fails for a reason that has nothing to do
   with the bump. Observed live at v0.1.81: both consumers' `platform/bump-v0.1.81`
   branches were cut ~17s after the release and ~seconds before the #242
   `dependabot.yml` change merged, so they would have run v0.1.81's new
   `dependabot-theme-gem-ignored.test.js` against a config that did not yet
   carry the ignore that lint asserts.

This is not a `platform-bump` bug — a branch cut at time T legitimately contains
`main` at time T. It is a **sequencing** hazard, and the fix is ordering:
**let every other `main` merge settle before dispatching `platform-bump`**, or,
if a bump PR is already open and stale, regenerate it rather than trying to
`update-branch` through the conflict. Regeneration is deterministic — run
`scripts/rewrite-platform-pins.js --from <CUR> --to <LATEST> --new-sha <release commit>`
over `platform.lock`, `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock` and `.github/workflows/**` on
top of current `main` (the workflow's own step: it moves only pins, never
prose that names the old version, cms-platform#530), then confirm with
`scripts/verify-consumer-pins.sh --platform-dir <platform>` before force-pushing
the bump branch. Caller SEEDING only matters if the release newly dictated a
workflow the consumer lacks; a release that adds none needs no seeding step.

### The bump runs the reusable pinned by the consumer (v0.1.126, #559)

The code that performs a bump comes from the consumer's CURRENT
`platform-bump.yml` `uses:` pin; `LATEST` is only the release it targets. The
fix in [PR #559](https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/cms-platform/pull/559)
shipped in v0.1.126, so both bumps TO v0.1.126 still ran the old reusable at
v0.1.125 (SHA `91392c279896f4eefcdc88343b1590dc013d0dd2`). Those runs used the
old global version replacement one last time: [adamdaniel.ai run
37185023596](https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/adamdaniel.ai/actions/runs/37185023596)
and [jodidaniel.com run
37185025916](https://github.com/jodidaniel/jodidaniel.com/actions/runs/37185025916).
The first clean bump FROM v0.1.126, targeting v0.1.127 or later, runs the fixed
rewrite. Historical comments already changed by the old replacement need
separate repairs in the affected consumer workflow files; the platform bump
does not repair those comments automatically.

### The consumer gate's stale-pin rule has one home, and two callers

`scripts/verify-consumer-pins.sh`'s check 2 — "no platform version token other
than the canonical one on any platform-mentioning line" — is the most GENERAL
pin detector here. Unlike `check-platform-pin-consistency.js`, which walks
parsed YAML by key, it reads LINES, so it sees a stale version token in a
LEFTOVER trailing `# vX.Y.Z (date)` comment on a `uses:` or a `platform_ref:` —
a shape a parser cannot see at all, because the parser drops comments. House
style carries no such comment since 2026-08-20, which is precisely why this
check still earns its place: it is what turns a stray surviving one into a
finding instead of an invisible lie.

It used to be an inline `awk` program. It now lives in
**`scripts/stale-platform-refs.js`** and is `require`d by
`e2e/template-pin-rules.js`, which is what the scaffold-template guard
(`e2e/examples-site-pins-current.test.js`) applies to `examples/site`. That is
deliberate and load-bearing: two earlier rounds gave the template guard its own
parse-only approximation of this rule, and each shipped a SPLIT — the guard
green on a drifted template while a site scaffolded from it exited 1 on its own
`verify-consumer-pins.sh`. Sharing the code removes the thing that can disagree.

Two consequences to know before changing either:

- **Changing the rule changes both.** Its output format is the awk's, verbatim,
  so the verifier's report is unchanged; the exit code is three-valued (0 clean,
  1 stale, 2 could-not-run) so "did not run" can never read as a pass.
- **`verify-consumer-pins.sh` now hard-FAILs without that file** in the
  `--platform-dir` tree, as it already did without the checker. Nothing in CI
  sparse-checks this script out (only `check-platform-pin-consistency.js` is,
  by `platform-pin-consistency.yml`), so no workflow needs a new path — but a
  hand-assembled platform dir does.
- `e2e/examples-site-scaffold-agreement.test.js` holds the line end-to-end: it
  mutates the template, applies the scaffolder's real `substitute()`, and runs
  this script on the result, asserting a shape can never red a scaffolded site
  while the template guard stays green.

## Pin AGREEMENT — the one-file check a fleet repo can actually run (#283)

Everything above is the CONSUMER story, and it stops at the two sites.
`check-platform-pin-consistency.js` needs a `platform.lock` for its canonical
ref, a gem `tag:`, and a `platform-pin-consistency` reusable wired into CI.
**Ten repos call a cms-platform reusable; only two have any of that.** The other
eight — `_agent-guidance`, `skills-evals`, `fastmail-actions`, `GHA-bench`,
`repo-settings`, `claude-memory-map`, `agentskills` and this repo's own
self-caller — carry a single thin caller and nothing else, so every guard on
this page is structurally unreachable from them.

### The defect

Each of those callers names the platform version TWICE:

```yaml
jobs:
  audit:
    uses: Adam-S-Daniel/cms-platform/.github/workflows/scheduled-run-health.yml@v0.1.88
    with:
      platform_ref: v0.1.88
```

Dependabot's `github-actions` ecosystem moves the first (a dependency ref) and
**structurally cannot** move the second (a `with:` input value). Four of the
seven carry no cms-platform `ignore`: three of them (`GHA-bench`,
`repo-settings`, `claude-memory-map`) run the `github-actions` ecosystem and are
live to the half-bump today, and `agentskills` has no `dependabot.yml` at all,
so nothing moves its pin in either direction. The skew that results is worse
than a crash: the NEW reusable runs against the OLD script its stale
`platform_ref` sparse-checks out; an argv-scanning `flag()` silently ignores a
flag it does not know; and the job goes **green**, having performed none of the
detection the new workflow asked for. Measured when #283 was filed: seven of the
eight sat on `v0.1.85`, a tag whose `scheduled-run-health.yml` has no push lane
at all, while `skills-evals` accumulated fourteen unreported failing
default-branch push runs its own health audit structurally could not see.

**#283's announced hand-mitigation has since landed, and the gap has already
re-opened — which is the whole point.** Re-measured 2026-08-20 by parsing each
repo's `origin/main` workflow tree: all seven now pin `scheduled-run-health.yml`
at `v0.1.87` with `platform_ref` agreeing, so the VALUES are consistent. But the
platform is at `v0.1.88` and both consumers are already there, moved by
`platform-bump.yml` — which never targets these seven. They are a release behind
again, one release after the hand-bump, exactly as #283 predicted. The hand-bump
fixed the values; nothing fixed the mechanism. #283 was nonetheless closed on
2026-08-20 without a fleet fix: the check below shipped, but no fleet repo
adopted it, so the half-bump stayed live in every two-ref caller. The mechanism
was removed only later, by #424, for `scheduled-run-health.yml` — see
[`docs/FLEET-CALLER-CURRENCY.md`](FLEET-CALLER-CURRENCY.md).

### The check

`scripts/check-pin-agreement.js`: **any mapping carrying both a `uses:@<ref>`
and a `with.platform_ref` must have the two refs equal.** That is all of it.

Three properties are the point, not incidental:

- **Identity-free.** No repo slug, no canonical version, no lockfile, no
  manifest — it compares a file against ITSELF. That is what makes it runnable
  by a repo with none of the machinery this page otherwise assumes. A job-level
  `uses:` is always a reusable WORKFLOW (steps, not jobs, name actions) and a
  `platform_ref` input only means anything to a platform reusable, so the
  pairing needs no configuration to disambiguate.
- **It parses.** Anchors have been legal in workflows since 2025-09-18, so
  either half can be an alias whose value is written elsewhere; a regex reads
  such a file as clean because it cannot see the value at all. `merge: true` is
  set for the same reason — without it a `<<:` merge key survives as a literal
  own key and a job assembled that way looks like a job with no `uses:` and no
  `with:`. Findings are located by KEY PATH (`jobs.audit`), not line number,
  because an aliased value's line is not the line to edit.
- **Three-valued exit.** `0` agree, `1` skew, `2` could-not-run — including a
  scan that examined ZERO files. Folding could-not-run into `0` is the exact
  silent-green failure this issue is about.

### Where it lives, and why not somewhere else

`.github/workflows/pin-agreement.yml` is a **reusable workflow**, because that
is the only delivery an adopting fleet repo can take: one thin caller, no Node
project, no lockfile, no local dependency. It checks the caller's tree out,
sparse-checks the script out of the platform, installs the `yaml` parser at the
exact version this repo already vets in `e2e/package.json`, and runs it.

Adopt it by copying the caller snippet in that file's header, triggered on
`pull_request` + `push` over `.github/workflows/**` — so a half-bump PR goes red
*before* it merges rather than after. **That also makes Dependabot safe to
re-enable** on the four repos that currently have no cms-platform `ignore`,
which is what un-stalls the three that do (their `ignore` was copied from the
consumers, where `platform-bump.yml` owns the version atomically — but
`platform-bump` never targets these repos, so nothing else moves the pin and
they simply stop).

**The caller checks itself, and that is sound in both broken directions.** The
check reads the CALLER's workflow tree, which is always current, so a half-bump
is caught even when the stale `platform_ref` hands it the OLD script; and a
`platform_ref` predating the script leaves nothing to execute, which fails the
step loudly. There is no arrangement of the two refs in which it quietly passes.

It is deliberately **not** added to `examples/site/.github/workflows/`. That set
is the consumer-dictated workflow set, so a new file there makes both consumers'
workflow-set parity report MISSING until they adopt it — and the consumers are
the two repos this skew already cannot reach.

`e2e/pin-agreement.test.js` (a registered meta-spec) drives the checker over
synthetic workflows, over `examples/site` and over this repo's own workflows,
and locks the reusable's shape.

### What this deliberately does NOT do

Two other options were on the table for #283 and are out of scope here:

- **Extending `platform-bump.yml` to these repos.** Atomic and correct, but they
  have no `platform.lock`, no gem and no pin-consistency gate, so most of what
  that workflow does would have nothing to act on.
- **Removing the second reference** — having the reusable resolve its own script
  from the ref it was called at, so `platform_ref:` need not exist for these
  callers and the skew class disappears entirely. This has since become
  reachable and is what #424 chose for `scheduled-run-health.yml`: the job
  context's `job.workflow_repository`/`job.workflow_sha` name the reusable's
  own commit. The decision, the evidence and the rejected options are in
  `docs/FLEET-CALLER-CURRENCY.md`.

This lint makes the skew LOUD. It does not make it impossible, and it was never
adopted by a fleet repo. #283 was closed without a fix. #424 then chose to
remove the second reference for `scheduled-run-health.yml` rather than adopt
this lint, because a lint moves no pin: every Dependabot bump would go red and
wait for a human. The lint stays shipped as a general check. See
`docs/FLEET-CALLER-CURRENCY.md`.

## A pin carries no version comment - lint-locked (2026-08-20)

The managed half of `AGENTS.md` states the rule; these two specs stop it
drifting back. Eleven PRs stripped every trailing `# vX.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)` label
fleet-wide and deleted the machinery that regenerated them, but nothing then
ASSERTED the absence - and a convention with no verifier returns the first time
an agent helpfully labels a SHA it just bumped, which is how the labels drifted
out of true to begin with.

- `e2e/action-pin-comment-lint.test.js` - the PLATFORM half: this repo's
  `.github/workflows/`, the `.github/actions/*/action.yml` composites, and the
  `examples/site` thin-caller templates. Registered in `PLATFORM_META_SPECS`.
- `e2e/consumer-action-pin-comment-lint.test.js` - the CONSUMER half: a site's
  own `.github` tree, where most of the fleet's pinned `uses:` lines actually
  live. Deliberately NOT registered (the #244 lesson - registering it would
  testIgnore it on the exact lane it exists for). Do not "tidy" it onto the list.

Both drive one detector, `e2e/pin-comment-rules.js`, so they cannot drift apart.

It PARSES, and that is what makes it correct rather than merely house-style
compliant. YAML comments are outside the data model, so `YAML.parse()` drops
them - but `YAML.parseDocument()` keeps a same-line trailing comment as
`node.comment` (verified against `yaml` 2.9.0 for plain, quoted,
last-line-no-newline, composite-action and flow-mapping shapes), so no lexical
fallback is needed. A line scan would also be WRONG here: two legal shapes carry
a version token in the VALUE - `…/e2e-tests.yml@v0.1.88` and
`docker://alpine:3.20` - and a regex over the line flags both. The detector
reads only the comment, so a tag-pinned own-account ref, a `./local` path and a

## platform-bump moves files and one dictated input, not just pins (#315)

A release can require three kinds of consumer-side change, and for a long time
the bump made only the first: it re-pins, it SEEDS a newly-dictated thin caller,
it RETIRES one that left the canonical set, and it RECONCILES
`cms-automerge-nudge.yml`'s `required_contexts` from the manifest's ruleset for
that repo. The retire and reconcile halves have to ride the bump commit —
pin-consistency compares the consumer's workflow set against the platform at
that consumer's OWN pinned ref, so splitting either off fails in the
mirror-image direction (`MISSING` instead of `EXTRA`).

Two things to keep straight if you touch it: "was this caller ever dictated?" is
answered by the canonical set at the OLD ref, never by "the consumer has a file
we don't recognise" — that distinction is what stops it deleting site-authored
workflows — and the `required_contexts` list is DERIVED per consumer from
`repo-settings.yml`, never copied from the template, because a consumer may map
`main` to a different library entry.

Note also that the check reporting `workflow-set: EXTRA` is
`platform-pin-consistency / pin-consistency`, NOT `parity / parity` (that one is
`parity-preview.yml`'s preview gate). Only the latter is in `consumer-main`'s
required set today, so a stale or orphaned caller currently reports on an
OPTIONAL check.
