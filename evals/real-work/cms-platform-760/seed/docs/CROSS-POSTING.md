# Cross-posting to Mastodon, LinkedIn + Substack

What this is: the reusable `cross-post.yml` workflow + its thin-caller
template, `scripts/cross_post/cross_post.py`, and the shape they enforce.
Read this before wiring cross-posting into a site, before changing
`cross_post.py`'s detect/render/verify/post logic, or before debugging a
cross-post run. Ported from adamdaniel.ai's site-local prototype
(cms-platform#442) — see `docs/VERSION-HISTORY.md`'s v0.1.109 entry for the
port's full rationale.

## What it does

On a push to `main` that touches `_posts/**` (or on a manual dispatch naming
one post), `cross-post.yml`:

1. Detects newly-published posts — on a push, diffs
   `github.event.before..github.sha` for `_posts/*.md` that went from
   unpublished (or absent) to `published: true`; on dispatch, takes the
   single `post_path` input (a backfill of an older post, or a re-run of one
   that failed to post the first time). Writes `cross-post-out/posts.json`
   and sets `changed`/`count` outputs.
2. When no leg is configured (`mastodon_instance: ""`, `linkedin: false`
   and `substack: false`, the caller template's defaults), prints
   `::notice::cross-posting is not configured for this site` and stops —
   every step after this one is gated on at least one leg being configured,
   so a site that hasn't wired any leg gets a harmless no-op run.
3. Awaits the production deploy (push only) via the platform's
   `await-prod-deploy` composite, so the run never verifies or cross-posts
   against a stale pre-merge site.
4. Verifies each detected post's public URL serves a 200 before posting
   anywhere.
5. Renders (when `substack: true`) a Mastodon status, a Substack-ready
   Markdown body, and a job-summary section per post, and uploads them as
   the `cross-post-<run_id>` artifact (30-day retention).
6. Posts to Mastodon (when `mastodon_instance` is non-empty) — idempotently:
   see "Dedupe / idempotency" below.
7. Shares the post to the token owner's LinkedIn profile (when
   `linkedin: true`) as an article card — one-shot, never retried: see
   "LinkedIn leg" below.

`targets` (default `all`) limits a run to one leg — `mastodon`, `linkedin`
or `substack` — so a manual re-run of the leg that failed cannot double-post
another. Detect, the deploy wait and the live check run whatever the value.

**On a `schedule`** (the thin caller's weekly Monday cron) the job does none
of the above: detect is skipped, so every step gated on
`steps.detect.outputs.changed == 'true'` stays off, and the only step that
runs is `check-linkedin-token` (when `linkedin: true`) — see "Rotating the
LinkedIn token". With `linkedin: false` a scheduled run is a no-op.

## Inputs

| Input | Type | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `prod_url` | string | *(required)* | Deployed production URL (scheme included, no trailing slash), e.g. `https://example.com`. Fed to `await-prod-deploy`'s `prod-url` on a push |
| `mastodon_instance` | string | `""` | Mastodon instance base URL, e.g. `https://hachyderm.io`. Empty skips the Mastodon leg entirely |
| `linkedin` | boolean | `false` | Share each new post to the token owner's LinkedIn profile as an article card. Also turns on the scheduled token-age check |
| `linkedin_token_minted` | string | `""` | The date the LinkedIn token was minted, `YYYY-MM-DD` — the caller passes `vars.LINKEDIN_TOKEN_MINTED`. Drives the expiry warnings |
| `substack` | boolean | `false` | Render + upload the Substack-ready Markdown draft. Substack has no publish API — this only controls whether the draft is produced; posting it is always paste-by-hand |
| `targets` | string | `all` | `all` / `mastodon` / `linkedin` / `substack`: run only that leg (a re-run of the one that failed) |
| `post_path` | string | `""` | One `_posts/*.md` to cross-post on a `workflow_dispatch`-shaped caller (backfill or re-run). Ignored on a push |
| `dry_run` | boolean | `false` | Log what would be posted to Mastodon and LinkedIn; post nothing |
| `visibility` | string | `public` | Mastodon post visibility (`public` / `unlisted` / `direct`) |
| `platform_repo` | string | `Adam-S-Daniel/cms-platform` | Where `cross_post.py` lives |
| `platform_ref` | string | `main` | Pin to the same ref as the caller's `uses:@ref` |

**Secret:** `MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN` (optional — when unset, `post-mastodon`
prints `::warning::Mastodon leg skipped: MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN is not set`
and exits 0, so the render/artifact/summary steps still complete).

**Secret:** `LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN` (optional — a 60-day member access token
with scopes `openid profile w_member_social`; when unset, `post-linkedin`
prints `::warning::LinkedIn leg skipped: LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN is not set`
and exits 0).

**Variable:** `LINKEDIN_TOKEN_MINTED` (a repo Actions *variable*, not a
secret — the date is not sensitive) — the `YYYY-MM-DD` the current LinkedIn
token was minted. The caller forwards it as `linkedin_token_minted`.

## The thin caller's trigger shape

`examples/site/.github/workflows/cross-post.yml` owns the trigger the
reusable does not:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - '_posts/**'
      - '!_posts/2099-*'   # prod-loop canaries (test_fixture)
      - '!_posts/*-e2e-*'  # e2e specs
  schedule:
    - cron: '23 6 * * 1'   # weekly LinkedIn token-age check only
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      post_path: { type: string, required: true }
      dry_run:   { type: boolean, default: true }
      visibility: { type: choice, options: [public, unlisted, direct], default: public }
      targets:   { type: choice, options: [all, mastodon, linkedin, substack], default: all }
```

The run-name carries a third branch for the cron (`scheduled — 23 6 * * 1`)
beside the `push — …` and `manual — …` forms.

**Fixture exclusion is belt-and-suspenders.** `cross_post.py`'s own `detect`
subcommand skips a post whose front matter carries `test_fixture: true` or
whose slug starts with `e2e-` — the same discriminator the rest of the
platform uses — so excluding those paths in the caller's trigger isn't
required for correctness; it just saves the run entirely rather than paying
for a detect-and-skip.

## Dedupe / idempotency

Before posting, `post-mastodon` resolves the account (`verify_credentials`)
and scans its 40 most recent original statuses for a link to the post's URL;
a match is reported as `already-posted` and nothing is sent, so a manual
re-run or a `main` push that re-detects a post cannot double-post. Each POST
also carries an `Idempotency-Key` derived from a SHA-256 of the post URL —
but Mastodon only honors that header for about an hour, so it is not a
substitute for the duplicate-post lookup on a re-run outside that window. If
the lookup itself is refused with HTTP 401 or 403 — meaning the token lacks
`read:statuses` — the run now prints an `::error::` and exits without posting
that post, or any later post in the same run: see "Creating the Mastodon app
token" below. Before v0.1.111, a `write:statuses`-only token made every
lookup come back 403, and that 403 was silently swallowed as a warning
followed by posting anyway, so the duplicate check never actually ran. Any
other lookup failure (5xx, a `0` from a network error, 404, and so on) still
only warns and posts anyway.

## Text formats by target — none of them renders Markdown

A post is Markdown; no target accepts it. Checked 2026-09-29:

| Target | Field | Format | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mastodon | `status` | Plain text. Links count as 23 characters; `#word` becomes a hashtag and `@word` a mention | [statuses API](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/statuses/), [posting](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/) |
| LinkedIn | `commentary` | "little text": plain text, reserved characters `\|{}@[]()<>#*_~` backslash-escaped | [little text format](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/community-management/shares/little-text-format) |
| LinkedIn | article `description` | Plain text | [Posts API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/community-management/shares/posts-api) |
| Substack | subtitle | Plain text | Substack editor |
| Substack | body | Rich text. Pasted Markdown is **not** converted | [DownStack guide](https://downstack.app/blog/markdown-to-substack-complete-guide/) |
| Substack | Note | Rich text from pasted rendered HTML (copied out of a browser) or the editor's formatting controls. Pasted Markdown or HTML source shows literally | Substack editor, checked by the owner 2026-09-29 |

So the excerpt that feeds the first four is rendered from a real Markdown
parse (`markdown-it-py`) to plain text: inline markup dropped (a link keeps
its text), soft breaks joined, images and raw HTML dropped, a list as `•`
lines, and a blockquote as its paragraphs wrapped in straight double quotes.
Before v0.1.115 the first paragraph went out as raw Markdown, and the
2026-09-28 LinkedIn post read `> The more time … > > We can do …`.

**A new target lands only with its row in this table, its own renderer if
the plain excerpt does not fit, and a test on a Markdown-heavy post.**

## `<link rel="me">` for each profile (v0.1.116)

List the profiles the site cross-posts to in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
cross_post:
  profiles:
    mastodon: https://hachyderm.io/@you
    linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/you
    substack: https://you.substack.com
```

The theme's `default.html` renders one `<link rel="me" href="...">` per
non-blank entry in `<head>`, ordered by target name, through
`_includes/rel-me.html` and the `rel_me_urls` filter
(`theme/lib/cms-platform-theme/rel_me_filter.rb`). Nothing renders when the
key is absent. A value that is not an absolute `https://` URL fails the
build, naming the key. A site with its own `<head>` (jodidaniel.com's home
layout) adds `{% include rel-me.html %}` itself.

`rel="me"` is how Mastodon verifies a profile link: add the site's URL as a
profile metadata field on the Mastodon account, and once the page links back
with `rel="me"` the field shows as verified. The profiles map is separate
from the workflow's `mastodon_instance` / `linkedin` inputs, because Jekyll
cannot read a workflow's inputs.

## Substack is paste-by-hand — there's no publish API

After a run with `substack: true`, download the `cross-post-<run_id>`
artifact from the run's page, open `<slug>.substack.html` in a browser,
select all, copy, and paste into a new Substack draft: Substack keeps the
formatting of pasted rich text but shows pasted Markdown literally. The
`<slug>.substack.md` source (also in the job summary) is kept for reference.
The render step also writes `<slug>.status.txt` (the Mastodon status) and
`<slug>.meta.json` (title/subtitle/url/slug/date/tags/featured_image)
alongside it. The HTML is rendered as CommonMark, so kramdown-only syntax
(attribute lists, footnotes) may differ from the site.

A **quotation post** (its first block, after any heading, is a blockquote)
renders `<slug>.substack.html` in the layout of a Substack Note instead of
the full article (v0.1.117): the title in bold, the quote, and the post URL,
which Substack turns into a link card. The attribution line after the quote
and the "Originally published at" header are left out, since the card
carries both. This matches the Note posted by hand for the 2026-09-28 Simon
Willison post. Any other post still renders as the full article.

## Creating the Mastodon app token

On your Mastodon instance (e.g. `hachyderm.io`): **Preferences → Development
→ New application**. Grant it **`profile`, `read:statuses`, and
`write:statuses`** — `profile` lets the dedupe step read the account's own id
via `verify_credentials` (a token missing it gets a 403 there; measured
2026-09-22), `read:statuses` lets that same step list the account's recent
statuses to check for a duplicate post, and `write:statuses` lets it actually
post. No other scope is needed, and the workflow never reads or writes
anything else on the account. Before v0.1.111 only `profile` and
`write:statuses` were required, but the dedupe lookup needs `read:statuses`
too (see "Dedupe / idempotency" above) — a `write:statuses`-only token made
that lookup 403 and the run silently posted anyway, without ever checking for
a duplicate.

Copy the generated access token into the site repo's **`MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN`**
Actions secret. Until the secret exists, `cross-post.yml` still runs to
completion (detect/verify/render/upload all happen when `substack: true`) —
only the Mastodon-posting step is skipped, with a `::warning::` in the run
log.

## LinkedIn leg

`post-linkedin` shares each detected post to the token owner's personal
profile through LinkedIn's versioned REST API:

- **Author.** `GET /v2/userinfo` (OpenID Connect, hence the `openid profile`
  scopes) resolves the member id; the post's author is
  `urn:li:person:<sub>`. A 401 there means the token expired or was revoked.
- **Article card + uploaded thumbnail.** The post is a `POST /rest/posts`
  with `content.article` — `source` (the post URL), `title` (≤ 400 chars),
  `description` (the excerpt, ≤ 4000 chars). LinkedIn does not scrape the
  URL for an image, so when the post has a `featured_image` the leg fetches
  it, calls `POST /rest/images?action=initializeUpload`, `PUT`s the bytes to
  the returned `uploadUrl` and sets `article.thumbnail` to the image URN. Any
  failure on that path is a `::warning::` and the post goes out without a
  thumbnail; the `PUT` carries the bearer token, so an `uploadUrl` outside
  `https://*.linkedin.com` is refused rather than followed.
- **Little-text escaping.** The `commentary` field is LinkedIn "little
  text", where `\ | { } @ [ ] ( ) < > # * _ ~` are reserved; the title and
  excerpt are backslash-escaped (`little_text_escape`) and each tag becomes a
  `{hashtag|\#|Word}` template. The commentary carries no URL — the article
  card does — and is capped at 2900 characters (excerpt truncated at a word
  boundary, then hashtags dropped).
- **`LinkedIn-Version`.** Every `/rest` call sends
  `LinkedIn-Version: <LINKEDIN_API_VERSION>` (a `YYYYMM` constant in
  `cross_post.py`) plus `X-Restli-Protocol-Version: 2.0.0`. LinkedIn sunsets
  versions after about a year and answers a sunset one with **HTTP 426**; the
  error names the constant to bump.
- **No dedupe, so one-shot by construction.** LinkedIn's posts API has no
  idempotency key and no cheap "have I shared this URL" lookup, so the leg
  cannot dedupe the way Mastodon does. Instead it only fires when detect sees
  a post newly published (or on a dispatch naming one), and it never retries.
  A dispatch's `targets` input limits a re-run to one leg, so re-running a
  failed Mastodon post cannot double-post to LinkedIn and vice versa.
- **A failed Mastodon leg does not skip LinkedIn.** Before v0.1.114 a red
  Mastodon step (adamdaniel.ai run 36430252461, a revoked token's HTTP 401)
  skipped LinkedIn through GitHub's implicit `success()`, and the post never
  reached either network. The Mastodon step now carries `continue-on-error`,
  LinkedIn still waits on every earlier gate (deploy landed, URL live), and a
  final `Fail if the Mastodon leg failed` step turns the run red afterward.
- **No retry on 5xx.** A 5xx or a dropped connection (`HTTP 0`) MAY have
  created the post; the error says so and asks you to check the profile
  before re-dispatching with `targets=linkedin`. The leg carries on with the
  remaining posts and exits 1 at the end if any failed.
- On `201` the post's URN (the `x-restli-id` response header) becomes
  `https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/<urn>/`, printed as `Posted: <url>`
  and written to `cross-post-out/<slug>.linkedin.json` as `{"urn", "url"}`.

Like the Mastodon leg, it never prints the token, an `Authorization` header
or a response body — an error is `HTTP <status>` only.

## Activating LinkedIn for a site

These are the steps adamdaniel.ai was activated with on 2026-09-22 (tracking
issue https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/adamdaniel.ai/issues/3776). Only the
profile owner can do them. The token goes straight from the LinkedIn page
into a GitHub secret. It is never pasted into chat, a log or a file.

1. **Create a LinkedIn Company Page** if the owner has none. A developer app
   cannot exist without one: LinkedIn says "API products available to
   individual developers must have a default page associated with them". On
   linkedin.com, open **For Business**, then **Create a Company Page**, then
   **Company**. Set the site URL as the website. The page is only the app's
   anchor, and posts still go to the member's own profile.
2. **Create the developer app** at
   https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps/new. Pick the page from step 1
   and upload any square logo.
3. **Verify the app against the page.** On the app's **Settings** tab, choose
   **Verify**, then **Generate URL**. Open that URL as the page's super admin
   and confirm.
4. **Add the two self-serve products** on the **Products** tab: **Share on
   LinkedIn** grants `w_member_social`, and **Sign In with LinkedIn using
   OpenID Connect** grants `openid profile`. Neither needs a review. The
   **Auth** tab should then list all three scopes.
5. **Mint the token** with the portal's generator,
   https://www.linkedin.com/developers/tools/oauth/token-generator. Pick the
   app, tick `openid`, `profile` and `w_member_social`, and approve. The
   token lives 60 days. The workflow needs neither the app's client secret
   nor a refresh token; a plain app is never issued one.
6. **Store the token and its mint date** from the owner's terminal. The first
   command prompts for the value:

   ```bash
   gh secret set LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN -R <owner>/<site>
   gh variable set LINKEDIN_TOKEN_MINTED -R <owner>/<site> --body YYYY-MM-DD
   ```

7. **Turn the leg on** in the site's thin caller: set `linkedin: true`. The
   `linkedin_token_minted`, `targets` and `LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN` lines are
   already in the template.
8. **Dry-run it.** Dispatch the caller with `dry_run: true` and
   `targets: linkedin`. A green run proves the token works, because the
   member id is resolved from `/v2/userinfo`. It also prints the commentary
   and card the leg would post, and it posts nothing. The first real post is
   the next newly published one; LinkedIn has no private or unlisted
   visibility to smoke-test against.

## Rotating the LinkedIn token

A member access token lives **60 days** and cannot be refreshed without the
member re-consenting, so it is rotated by hand. The token-age check reads the
`LINKEDIN_TOKEN_MINTED` variable: the posting leg warns from day 50 and
refuses to post from day 60 (no request is made); the weekly scheduled run
goes red from day 50, on purpose, so the fleet's scheduled-run-health audit
files an issue while there is still time.

To rotate:

1. Mint a new token with the generator, as in step 5 above. Use the same app
   and the same three scopes.
2. Overwrite both values:

   ```bash
   gh secret set LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN -R <owner>/<site>
   gh variable set LINKEDIN_TOKEN_MINTED -R <owner>/<site> --body YYYY-MM-DD
   ```

3. Dispatch the caller with `dry_run: true` and `targets: linkedin` to prove
   the new token. A green run confirms it.

The weekly run goes green again on its next schedule, and scheduled-run-health
closes its issue after a clean window. If a post was refused while the token
was dead, re-post it with a dispatch naming that `post_path`, plus
`targets: linkedin` and `dry_run: false`. Check the profile first: a refused
post made no request, but a 5xx one may have landed.

## The default is a no-op, on purpose

A site that copies the thin-caller template and changes nothing gets
`prod_url: https://example.com`, `mastodon_instance: ""`, `linkedin: false`
and `substack: false`. Every push to `_posts/**` on `main` still runs the
workflow, detects the newly-published post, and then prints
`::notice::cross-posting is not configured for this site` and stops — no
Mastodon or LinkedIn posting attempt, no Substack render, no artifact; the
weekly scheduled run does nothing at all. Turning on any leg is a one-line
edit to the caller's `with:` block plus (for Mastodon or LinkedIn) a repo
secret.

## `await-prod-deploy` by local path, not a remote pin

The reusable's "Checkout platform scripts" step checks this repo out into
`.cms-platform/` at `platform_ref`, and the "Await production deploy" step
then references the composite by the LOCAL path that checkout produces —
`uses: ./.cms-platform/.github/actions/await-prod-deploy` — never
`Adam-S-Daniel/cms-platform/.github/actions/await-prod-deploy@<ref>`. A
consumer repo that enforces `sha_pinning_required` in its actions-permissions
policy rejects a cross-repository composite action referenced by tag or SHA
outright at job setup ("all actions must be pinned to a full-length commit
SHA" — GitHub applies this to a composite from ANOTHER repository too, not
just first-party `uses:` lines), and a platform composite is deliberately
never SHA-pinned-with-a-trailing-comment fleet-wide any more (see
`docs/PIN-CONSISTENCY.md`). The platform's own prod-mutating loop reusables
(`cms-publish-loop-prod.yml`, `cms-publish-loop-host.yml`,
`cms-media-roundtrip.yml`, `cms-scheduled-publish-loop.yml`) already call
`await-prod-deploy` the same way — `cross-post.yml` follows their shape
rather than reinventing one. `scripts/cross_post/tests/test_workflow_shape.py`
lint-locks this: it asserts the reusable's text never contains
`Adam-S-Daniel/cms-platform/.github/actions/` and that the local path is
actually used.

## Cross-post watcher (Claude routine)

The reusable's last step, "Fire the cross-post watcher", fires a Claude Code
routine: an agent that audits the cross-posts, backfills what is missing and
notifies. The routine id is `trig_013iDZwBZ5mY5zcAayas6ASW`; its page is
https://claude.ai/code/routines/trig_013iDZwBZ5mY5zcAayas6ASW.

**When it fires**

- Every `push` run of a site with at least one leg configured, whether or not
  detect found a post. Detect missing a post is the bug class the watcher
  exists to catch, so the fire cannot depend on `detect`'s output.
- A scheduled run whose weekly LinkedIn token-age check failed.
- **Never on `workflow_dispatch`.** The watcher backfills by dispatching this
  workflow; firing on a dispatch would loop.

The step uses `!cancelled()`, so it also runs after a failed leg, and it is
last, so it never masks the step that turns a swallowed Mastodon failure red.

**What it does with Substack.** Substack has no publish API, so the owner
still pastes the draft by hand. The watcher verifies the paste itself: it
reads the owner's public profile feed,
`https://substack.com/api/v1/reader/feed/profile/311451833`. A Note whose
first line equals the post's title (after quote and whitespace
normalization), or an item that contains the post's URL, dated on or after the
post's commit, ticks the ledger issue's Substack box with that item's link.
The watcher closes the ledger once every configured leg is ticked. It also
sweeps every open ledger, whatever its age, so a late paste closes on the
next fire. The routine's Claude environment allows `substack.com` for this
(`_agent-guidance`'s `docs/reference/network-allowlist-claude-environments.txt`).

**Wiring (per site)**

- Secret `CLAUDE_ROUTINE_CROSSPOSTWATCHER`: the routine's bearer token.
- Repository variable `CROSS_POST_WATCHER_ROUTINE_ID`: the routine id. The
  The reusable reads it directly (`vars` in a reusable workflow resolves to
  the caller repo's variables), so the thin caller has no `with:` key for it.

**Fail-open.** With the variable unset nothing fires. With the id set but the
secret empty, the step prints a `::warning::` and exits 0. A non-2xx response
fails the step with the HTTP status code only; the response body is never
logged. The message sent carries the repository, event, run URL, head sha and
detect's `changed`/`count` outputs, with no secrets or personal data. The API
allows 30 fires per hour per routine.

## Testing

`scripts/cross_post/cross_post.py` is stdlib + PyYAML only, and every
function that talks HTTP takes an injectable transport so the suite needs no
real network. `python3 -m pytest scripts/cross_post -q` runs:

- `test_detect.py` — front-matter parsing, slugging, site settings,
  `newly_published`/`is_fixture` detection, `detect_from_git` (both a fake
  `git` and a real throwaway repo).
- `test_render.py` — `describe_post`'s excerpt fallback chain, hashtag
  derivation, the exact Mastodon status format (including the length-cap
  word-boundary truncation), and `substack_markdown`'s embed-marker /
  relative-link rewriting.
- `test_mastodon.py` — `verify_live`'s polling/backoff, `post_mastodon`'s
  auth header, idempotency key, dedupe skip, dry-run, no-token skip, and
  that an error response body is NEVER printed (it may carry secrets).
- `test_linkedin.py` — little-text escaping, the `{hashtag|\#|Word}`
  format, the commentary format and its truncation, token-age edges
  (49/50/59/60, missing, garbage), the no-token and expired-by-date paths
  making zero requests, author resolution, the exact `/rest/posts` URL,
  headers and body, the `x-restli-id` → URL + `<slug>.linkedin.json`, dry
  run, the thumbnail upload and its failure at each step, the 401/426/5xx/0
  messages, continue-then-exit-1, and that an error body is never printed.
- `test_cli.py` — the `detect`/`render`/`post-mastodon`/`post-linkedin`/
  `check-linkedin-token` subcommands end to end against a `tmp_path` fixture
  site.
- `test_workflow_shape.py` — the reusable + template shape lints described
  above.

`self-ci.yml`'s `python-unit-tests` job runs the full suite on every PR that
touches this repo, and since #525 it is one of the seven required status
contexts (`repo-settings.yml`'s `platform-main` ruleset), so a red run blocks
the merge. Adding a required context is a `repo-settings.yml` decision, not
something a new lane should make by merely existing.
