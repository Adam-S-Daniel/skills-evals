# Operations: running, diagnosing and approving things by hand

The how-tos AGENTS.md points at. Each one is a procedure with a cost behind
it — a wasted prod-mutating loop run, an approval given on the wrong evidence,
a local lane that cannot be reproduced — so the reasoning travels with the
commands rather than being compressed out of them.

Contents: the verify commands, the machine/session gotchas, approving
`regression-review`, what a validation dispatch actually exercises, reading a
failed loop run, pre-running the required lint lane, installing the e2e
fixture's gems, and what to grep before deleting a consumer file.

## Verify

Before claiming a change is done, run both generators against throwaway inputs
and syntax-check what you touched:

```bash
ruby scripts/render-decap-config.rb <site> <site>/_site   # Decap render
node scaffold/create-site.js /tmp/x --yes --domain d --repo d --owner o   # scaffolder
# workflows: python3 -c 'import yaml,...' parse + bash -n the run: blocks
```

## Environment gotchas (this machine / web)

- **The local checkout can be STALE/detached** — before any analysis or work,
  `git fetch && git checkout main` (or compare against `origin/main`), then branch
  off `origin/main`. An old checkout may not reflect landed migrations (e.g. the
  `admin/` → `theme/admin` move, the gem-delivered admin model) and you'll reason
  about machinery that no longer exists. Verify HEAD == `origin/main` first.
- The **web** GitHub MCP connector can't create repos (403); `/teleport` to local
  and use `gh` (authed as Adam-S-Daniel, scopes incl. `repo`,`workflow`).
- Background sessions: editing a non-cwd repo checkout trips a worktree-isolation
  prompt on the Edit/Write tools — write via Bash (`cat >`, a Python pass) which
  isn't tool-guarded. Writing `.claude/settings.json` is blocked as self-mod.

### A live repo-settings check may be IMPOSSIBLE from the session (v0.1.76)

The egress proxy in a sandboxed authoring session returns **403 for
`/actions/variables` and `/actions/secrets`** on all three repos, so whether a
credential is actually provisioned cannot be verified from there — during
v0.1.76, `CMS_AUTOMATION_APP_ID` / `CMS_AUTOMATION_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` could not be
confirmed. **State the limitation honestly rather than asserting either way**, and
design credential-dependent features to **fail SOFT**: absent credentials must
produce a clear notice that names the EXACT knobs, never a crash and never a
silent no-op. The pattern was set by `dependabot-comment-sync.yml` (deleted
2026-08-20 with the pin-comment convention): no App credential simply meant it
skipped with a notice naming all three knobs (`CMS_PLATFORM_PAT` /
`vars.CMS_AUTOMATION_APP_ID` / `CMS_AUTOMATION_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`), which is what
keeps "never onboarded" distinguishable from "misconfigured". `repo-settings-apply.yml`
carries the same shape today, and so do `platform-bump.yml` and
`dev-hooks-sync.yml`, which since #238 read `CMS_AUTOMATION_APP_ID` /
`CMS_AUTOMATION_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` as the CMS automation App that replaces the
consumer's `CMS_PLATFORM_PAT` (App → PAT → `GITHUB_TOKEN`; lint-locked by
`e2e/app-token-platform-writers.test.js`). Whether a consumer has provisioned
the App is exactly the thing this section says cannot be read from a session:
look for the `::notice::Minted …` line in a bump run's log, not at the
settings page.

## Approving `regression-review` on a render-neutral PR

`visual-regression` screenshots the PR against **production**, and prod lags
`main` — so a version-bump or delete-only PR that changes nothing a visitor sees
routinely reports pre-existing drift as its own diff and parks on the manual
`regression-review` gate.

- Do NOT re-run hoping it flips green, and do NOT widen the salience detector
  (`e2e/detect-changed-pages.js`) or the thin caller's `paths:` content-skip list
  to dodge it — both are lint-locked
  (`e2e/visual-regression-content-skip.test.js`, `-skip-review.test.js`) and
  widening either blinds the gate for every future PR.
- Read the shape first: `Visually different ≥ 1` with `Text changed: 0` is the
  false-positive signature (see `docs/VERSION-HISTORY.md`, v0.1.73).
- Prove the PR is render-neutral BEFORE approving. Both must hold:
  `git diff --stat <old-tag> <new-tag> -- theme/` is EMPTY (the gem's render is
  unchanged), and every deleted asset is unreferenced across `_layouts/`,
  `_includes/`, the index page and `_config.yml`.
- Only then approve the environment gate:
  `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/runs/<run-id>/pending_deployments` to read
  the environment id and `current_user_can_approve`, then
  `gh api -X POST .../pending_deployments -f state=approved -F "environment_ids[]=<id>"`.
  The approver must be a configured reviewer of the `regression-review`
  environment (see the `consumer-repo-provisioning` skill).
- If either check fails, the gate is doing its job — review the pixels, don't
  approve.

## A validation dispatch tests the code that is REACHABLE, not the code you merged

A host-loop iteration costs over an hour (`cms-publish-loop-host.yml` runs four
`@admin-write` specs at `--workers=1`, `timeout-minutes: 150`), so a dispatch
that exercises the wrong bytes burns a whole cycle. Two ways that happens, both
observed:

- **The CDN is still serving the old admin.** `deploy-production` concluding
  `success` is NOT proof prod `/admin` changed: the admin assets sit behind
  CloudFront and the deploy fires `create-invalidation` WITHOUT waiting for it to
  complete, so the edge can keep serving the previous asset for minutes. A
  re-dispatch once raced it, fetched the old `publish-via-auto-merge.js`, and
  spent a full run failing on a defect that was already fixed and merged.
  **Curl the served asset and grep for the new symbol before dispatching:**
  `curl -s https://<apex>/admin/<file>.js | grep <new-symbol>`.
- **`gh workflow run` against a stale branch.** Dispatching on a dead feature
  branch runs THAT branch's code and resurrects failures the fix already removed.
  Dispatch on current HEAD, and delete feature branches once merged.

So for any change to a gem-shipped `/admin` asset: land the consumer bump, let
its `deploy-production` finish, verify the SERVED asset, then dispatch.

Watching such a run from a Claude Code session outlasts a single watcher:
background Bash stops at its `timeout` (default 30 min, max 2 h, since 2.1.285)
and `Monitor` at 30 min; another agent harness has its own limits. **Pass `timeout` explicitly and re-arm on the stop
notice**, re-checking `gh run view "$RUN" --json status,conclusion` first (a
stop is not a completion). See the `ci-watcher-loops` skill
(`skills/ci-watcher-loops/SKILL.md`).

## Diagnose a failed loop run from its ARTIFACTS, not from the logs

`gh run download <run-id>`, then read `test-failed-1.png` and `error-context.md`
BEFORE theorising. A host-loop iteration is over an hour of real prod mutation
(`cms-publish-loop-host.yml` runs four `@admin-write` specs at `--workers=1`,
`timeout-minutes: 150`), so a wrong guess costs a full cycle — and what these
specs catch are Decap UI-state bugs (a Save button gone `disabled`, a confirming
toast that already faded) that a log physically cannot show. The v0.1.36 layer in
`docs/VERSION-HISTORY.md` was cracked by the screenshot alone, after log-reading
had already produced two wrong root causes.

## Pre-run the required lint lane locally

`node-unit-lints` is a REQUIRED check and the cheapest one to reproduce. Mirror
it from `e2e/`:

```bash
TARGET=prod PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 \
  npx playwright test --project=chromium-light --reporter=line ./*.test.js
```

Run the WHOLE `*.test.js` set, not just the files you touched — these lints
cross-reference each other, so an edit in one file routinely reds a lint in
another.

Two classes of local red are EXPECTED, not regressions: the build-dependent
specs on `self-ci.yml`'s DENY list, and anything needing a Jekyll toolchain on a
box that has none. Check a red against that list before chasing it.

## Install the e2e fixture's gems into the fixture, not the system gem path

With `GEM_HOME` unset, bundler defaults to an unwritable `/var/lib/gems` and the
`e2e/fixture-site` gem install fails outright — which blocks every lint that
needs the fixture's `bundle exec` (e.g. `e2e/base-collections-skip-meta.test.js`,
which requires the fixture to have resolved gems). Scope the fix to the fixture
rather than fixing it globally:

```bash
cd e2e/fixture-site && bundle config set --local path vendor/bundle && bundle install
```

`vendor/` and `.bundle/` are already gitignored there — and `.bundle/` is
precisely what does NOT travel with a clone, so this is a one-time step on every
fresh checkout, not a fix someone forgot to commit.

## The production 404 page is never cacheable

CloudFront answers every missing key on the production distribution with
`/404.html` (`CustomErrorResponses`, `ErrorCachingMinTTL: 0`) and passes that
object's own `Cache-Control` through. `deploy-production.yml` syncs the site
with `public, max-age=86400`, so while `404.html` rode that sync every 404
reached browsers as cacheable for a day
(`curl -sSI https://<apex>/assets/images/uploads/nonexistent.jpeg` showed it).
An editor's draft image 404s on the admin's origin until its post publishes,
and that cached 404 kept the image broken in the editor's browser after the
file was live.

So the sync excludes `404.html` (an excluded key is also spared by
`--delete`) and the next step, "Upload 404 page (not cacheable)", copies it
with `no-cache, must-revalidate` when the site has one. A site that stops
shipping `404.html` keeps the last uploaded copy until someone removes it.
`e2e/deploy-production-404-cache.test.js` holds both halves;
`e2e/cms-media-roundtrip.spec.js` checks the live header. `deploy-preview.yml`
already uploads everything no-cache.

## Before deleting anything from a consumer, grep the PLATFORM too

A file with no references anywhere inside a consumer repo can still be
load-bearing: the platform's own e2e specs reach into a consumer's tree by
HARDCODED path, and a consumer-only grep is blind to that.

A thin-ification audit that checked page and site references only listed
`assets/images/uploads/e2e-preview-media-probe.png` as a stray upload safe to
delete. It is the sentinel `e2e/preview-media-resolves.spec.js` fetches to prove
the flat `media_folder` resolves on the preview surface — deleting it 404s the
probe and reds the REQUIRED `preview-media` check.

So: grep **all three repos**, `cms-platform/e2e` and `cms-platform/scripts`
included, before removing a consumer file. "No in-repo references" is a necessary
condition, never a sufficient one. (That specific sentinel is now lint-locked by
`checkMediaProbeSentinel()` in `scripts/check-platform-pin-consistency.js` and by
`e2e/scaffold-seeds-media-probe.test.js` — the class of miss is not.)
