/*
 * audit-scheduled-runs.js — the workflow-run health audit: make silent
 * scheduled-workflow AND default-branch-push failures LOUD.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM (observed live, 2026-07 audit): scheduled workflows fail
 * silently. Nothing surfaces an `event=schedule` failure beyond the Actions
 * tab — no PR goes red, no notification fires. adamdaniel.ai's daily
 * editorial-label-audit was red 24 of 30 days for three straight weeks
 * unnoticed; jodidaniel.com's sweep-stale-cms-prs failed 30/30 for a month
 * (a `startup_failure` from a dropped `secrets:` map) before anyone looked.
 *
 * THE FIX: scan this repo's workflow runs from the last N hours (default 48)
 * for `event=schedule` conclusions of failure / startup_failure / timed_out,
 * and open-or-update a SINGLE tracking issue (found via a hidden HTML marker
 * + label):
 *   - failures + no open tracking issue  → open it (the issue notification IS
 *     the alert — the repo owner watches their own repo);
 *   - failures + open issue              → comment ONLY the runs not already
 *     reported (dedupe by run id, recorded in a hidden `<!-- run-ids: … -->`
 *     block so the visible report can stay capped);
 *   - no failures in the window + open issue → close it with a "clean window"
 *     comment. The issue lifecycle mirrors reality: open while scheduled runs
 *     are failing, closed once a full window passes clean.
 *
 * WHY A 48h WINDOW FOR A DAILY AUDIT: GitHub throttles crons on these repos —
 * measured, five-minute crons fire every 45-90 min and daily/weekly crons run
 * 4-5 HOURS late. Two consecutive daily audit runs can therefore be up to
 * ~29h apart; a 24-25h window would leave a blind gap. Doubling to 48h means
 * lag can never skip a failure, and the run-id dedupe keeps the double
 * coverage from double-reporting.
 *
 * A LATER SUCCESS DOES NOT CLEAR A FAILURE: closing on recovery was replayed
 * against 30 days of real runs and rejected — docs/HEALTH-AUDIT-CLOSE-RULE.md.
 *
 * DEFAULT-BRANCH PUSH FAILURES ARE THE SAME BLIND SPOT (#279): the
 * `event=schedule` scan does nothing for a `push`-to-default-branch failure,
 * which is exactly as invisible — no PR to go red on, no notification.
 * Live incident, 2026-08: a `.gitleaks.toml` change on adamdaniel.ai passed
 * its PR check (the PR lane scans `base..head`) but broke every `push`-to-
 * `main` run of `secrets-scan.yml` (the push lane scans full history) — 8
 * CONSECUTIVE pushes failed, each one a blocked Decap editorial publish, and
 * no tracking issue was ever filed. The push lane reuses every mechanism
 * above unchanged (same run-id dedupe channel, same runner-starvation
 * suppression, same tracking issue) — only the query narrows to
 * `event=push` on the repo's own default branch (read from the SAME repo-
 * metadata call the dead-workflow check already makes; no hardcoded `main`,
 * no extra API call) instead of `event=schedule`. The two lanes render as
 * separate sections (`secrets-scan.yml` fires on BOTH events, and a merged
 * list would bury exactly the signal the incident needed — "scheduled green,
 * push on fire") but share one close-gate: the issue does not close until
 * scheduled runs, push runs, AND dead workflows are ALL clean.
 *
 * ABSENCE IS NOT HEALTH (#258): a run-only detector cannot see a workflow that
 * emits NO runs. GitHub auto-disables a scheduled workflow after 60 days with
 * no repository activity (PUBLIC repos only), and a disabled workflow
 * contributes nothing to `actions/runs?event=schedule` — so the audit scored it
 * `0 failing scheduled run(s) … All scheduled workflows healthy` and, worse,
 * CLOSED an open tracking issue on the strength of that silence. The signal is
 * one field: `GET /actions/workflows` returns `state` ∈ `active | deleted |
 * disabled_fork | disabled_inactivity | disabled_manually`. Dead cron-bearing
 * workflows now join failing runs in the SAME finding set and the same
 * open/comment/close lifecycle — only the input set widened. Two properties
 * keep this from re-growing the bug it fixes: the check is public-repos-only
 * (the 60-day rule does not apply elsewhere, and a private repo's disabled cron
 * is off by intent), and an UNKNOWN answer — a failed probe, an ambiguous
 * visibility — never counts as "no findings": it suppresses the auto-close and
 * reds the audit, because "we could not tell" is the audit failing at its job.
 *
 * RUNNER STARVATION IS NOT A FAILURE (suppressed): GitHub reports the RUN as
 * `failure` when its job(s) were CANCELLED before a runner was ever assigned —
 * `runner_id: 0`, empty `runner_name`, no steps (observed live on
 * jodidaniel.com runs 31118167966 and 31120011930). That is infrastructure
 * noise, not a broken workflow, and the RUN conclusion alone cannot tell the
 * two apart — so an otherwise-alertable run has its JOBS fetched and is
 * suppressed when every job is cancelled-without-a-runner (or skipped). The
 * suppressed count + workflow names are still emitted as a `::notice::`, so a
 * systemic runner outage stays visible instead of becoming invisible.
 *
 * EXIT CODE CONTRACT: exit 0 when the audit COMPLETED (even when failures
 * were found — the tracking issue is the alert channel); non-zero only when
 * the audit itself could not do its job (API/permission failure). A red
 * audit run therefore means "the alerting layer is broken", not "something
 * it watches is broken" — the same "red means needs a human" contract as
 * audit-editorial-labels.js --fix.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/audit-scheduled-runs.js [--repo owner/name] \
 *     [--window-hours 48] [--label ci] [--dry-run] [--no-push-scan]
 *     [--stale-days 14] [--no-stale-scan]
 *
 * Requires a gh-authenticated environment (GH_TOKEN or gh auth) with
 * actions: read (list runs) + issues: write (open/comment/close).
 * Pure helpers are exported for unit tests (e2e/scheduled-run-health.test.js);
 * the require.main guard keeps the CLI from running on import.

const MARKER = "<!-- scheduled-run-health-audit -->";
const ISSUE_TITLE = "Workflow runs are failing (automated health audit)";
// `cancelled` is deliberately EXCLUDED: the loop workflows cancel superseded
// runs by design (concurrency groups), so a cancelled scheduled run is not a
// health signal. `action_required` never occurs for schedule events. That
// exclusion is RUN-level only — see isRunnerStarvationRun for the case where
// the RUN says `failure` but its only job was cancelled without a runner.
//
// DO NOT ADD `cancelled` HERE, AND #289 IS THE REASON SOMEONE WILL WANT TO.
// A job GitHub kills at its `timeout-minutes` wall reports conclusion
// `cancelled`, NOT `timed_out` — so when three REQUIRED contexts on
// adamdaniel.ai (#3202, #3217) died on a 30-minute wall, this audit was silent
// even though `timed_out` sits in the list right above. The temptation is to
// close that by admitting `cancelled`. It cannot be done here, for two
// independent reasons:
//
//   1. IT WOULD DISARM THE RUNNER-STARVATION CARVE-OUT. The suppression this
//      audit depends on (isRunnerStarvationRun, below) is ITSELF a
//      cancelled-jobs shape: `runner_id: 0`, no runner name, no steps. Treating
//      `cancelled` as bad at run level makes that suppression meaningless, and
//      the alert channel goes back to crying wolf on every runner outage.
//   2. IT IS THE WRONG LANE ANYWAY. This audit scans `event=schedule` and
//      `event=push` on the default branch. A required context wedging a merge
//      is an `event=pull_request` run, which neither query returns. A detector
//      for "a context named in a live ruleset ended cancelled" would be a THIRD
//      lane over open PRs and their check rollups, needing `pull-requests: read`
//      + `checks: read`, and needing to distinguish a cancelled run superseded
//      by a later push (routine, constant) from a cancelled run still sitting on
//      the PR's CURRENT head sha with no successful sibling for that context
//      (the wedge). That is a separate change with its own evidence and its own
//      false-positive tuning, not a one-word edit to this array.
//
// The cause is instead prevented at the source, which is where it is cheap:
// `e2e/required-context-cancellable.test.js` and its CONSUMER-mode sibling
// reject a `timeout-minutes` on any job that publishes a required context, and
// `parity-preview.yml` / `preview-media.yml` now carry the wall on a work job
// whose conclusion no ruleset names.

// turned off during an incident and forgot to turn back on.
const DEAD_WORKFLOW_STATES = ["disabled_inactivity", "disabled_manually"];

// THAT PREMISE IS GITHUB'S DOCUMENTED BEHAVIOUR, NOT MEASURED HERE: a 60-day
// auto-disable cannot be induced in a test, and there is no live specimen to
// read it off (measured 2026-08-17, all 111 workflows across cms-platform,
// adamdaniel.ai and jodidaniel.com are `state=active`). If GitHub ever sets
// the state some other way, the blast radius is bounded to one extra reported
// line, once per tracking issue, about a workflow that genuinely IS disabled.
// Re-deriving that from a runs probe can only LOSE information: the probe
// answers "no" identically for "never a cron" and "its run records are gone"
// (runs deleted via DELETE /actions/runs/{id} or the Actions tab), and a "no"
// there silently drops the workflow from the finding set. That is #258

// ── THE STALENESS LANE (#313) ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// Both lanes above key off a RUN CONCLUSION, and `cancelled` is excluded from
// BAD_CONCLUSIONS for a reason that cannot be revisited: the runner-starvation
// carve-out is itself a cancelled shape. That exclusion is a contract, not an
// oversight — and it left a whole failure class structurally invisible.
//
// MEASURED (#313): `repo-settings-apply.yml` fired its daily cron for eleven
// consecutive days and converged NOTHING. Twelve runs concluded `cancelled`,
// each evicted from a concurrency group held by a run parked at an unapproved
// environment gate; every one allocated zero jobs. No conclusion in
// BAD_CONCLUSIONS ever appeared, so this audit reported the repo healthy
// throughout while both consumers' branch protection sat unconverged.
//
// The lane below is deliberately CONCLUSION-AGNOSTIC, which is exactly what
// lets it coexist with that contract: it never asks whether a run failed, only
// whether the workflow has SUCCEEDED lately. `cancelled`, `failure`,
// `startup_failure`, runner starvation and a wedged gate all reach it by the
// same door, and the carve-out above is untouched.
//
// Its candidate set is the workflows that appear in the scheduled runs ALREADY
// fetched for the lane above — no extra listing call, and, more importantly, no
// cadence false positive: a workflow is only ever judged on a day it actually
// fired, so a weekly cron is never scored against a daily threshold.
//
// THE HISTORY CALL CAN LIE (found twice in production): the per-workflow
// listing (`fetchHistory`, a SEPARATE API call fired after the window listing
// above) came back a ~3-week-old snapshot while the window listing already
// held a recent success of the SAME workflow — jodidaniel.com#264, 2026-09-23
// (`editorial-label-audit.yml` read "last succeeded 19 day(s) ago" while it had
// succeeded daily, newest success the day before) and adamdaniel.ai, 2026-09-10
// (`cms-automerge-nudge.yml` read "24 day(s) ago" while succeeding ~7x/day).
// Both were false STALE findings from trusting a listing that contradicted
// ground truth the audit already held. Two rules close it, neither of which
// touches `staleVerdict` itself:
//   1. WINDOW SUCCESS SHORT-CIRCUITS. If the window listing itself already
//      shows a recent success for a candidate, that workflow is not stale and
//      `fetchHistory` is never called for it — the window listing is ground
//      truth (fetched moments before this lane runs), so there is nothing for
//      a second, later call to usefully contradict.
//   2. A HISTORY THAT OMITS A WINDOW RUN NEWER THAN ITS OWN OLDEST RUN IS A
//      STALE SNAPSHOT, NOT EVIDENCE OF STALENESS. `fetchHistory` runs strictly
//      after the window listing, so it can only ever contain MORE recent runs,
//      never fewer — any window run at least as new as the history's oldest
//      run must appear in it. A window run OLDER than the history's oldest run
//      may legitimately be missing (a frequent cron can fire more than
//      `STALE_SCAN_RUNS` times inside the 48h window) and is not checked. A
//      violation throws, which the caller (findStaleWorkflows) routes into the
//      existing probeFailed path — "could not tell", never "stale".

// WHY A RUNS PROBE AND NOT THE WORKFLOW FILE'S `on:` BLOCK: the reusable

//
// WHY THE PROBE NOW SCOPES `disabled_manually` ONLY: for
// `disabled_inactivity` it is redundant AND lossy. Redundant because the state
// is self-evidencing (SELF_EVIDENCING_CRON_STATES). Lossy because it answers
// from run RECORDS, and "no records" is byte-identical for "never a cron" and
// "the records were deleted" — a "no" there removes the workflow from the

// probe for that state is not a heuristic trade: a strictly weaker signal
// stops overruling a stronger one, and it costs one fewer API call per dead
// workflow. `disabled_manually` implies nothing about a cron, so it keeps the
