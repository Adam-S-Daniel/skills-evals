/*
 * admin/branch-binding-banner.js — says which branch this admin is bound to,
 * on every screen, whenever that is not the branch the site deploys to
 * production from (cms-platform#412).
 *
 * ── The defect ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * deploy-preview.yml patches the served admin/config.yml through
 * scripts/patch-preview-config.sh, so a preview's /admin is bound to the PR
 * branch: `backend.branch` is the PR head, `site_url` the preview host. That
 * is right — a preview admin editing the PR branch is the point. But the two
 * admins are byte-identical apart from that one config line, and an editor
 * arrives at the preview one routinely, via the link the preview bot posts on
 * every PR. So every string written for the production case is read verbatim
 * on a surface where it is false: "publish", "the site", "visible to the
 * public" all name the production site from a surface bound to a branch.
 * Measured on jodidaniel.com, 2026-09-04:
 *
 *   $ curl -s https://jodidaniel.com/admin/config.yml               | grep '^  branch:'
 *     branch: main
 *   $ curl -s https://preview-pr247.jodidaniel.com/admin/config.yml | grep '^  branch:'
 *     branch: claude/controls-gating-label-or72js
 *
 * Per-field copy cannot carry this. It is not a property of any field; it is
 * a property of the SURFACE. So it is stated once, here, at the top of every
 * screen — and only on the surface where it is true.
 *
 * ── Read from the config, never guessed from the hostname ──────────────
 * The verdict is `served backend.branch !== window.CMS_PRODUCTION_BRANCH`.
 *
 *   - The SERVED value is read from the same admin/config.yml Decap itself
 *     loads (fetched relative to this document, past the HTTP cache), at the
 *     line anchor patch-preview-config.sh WRITES: `^  branch:`. The reader
 *     mirrors the writer, and e2e/branch-binding-banner.test.js runs the real
 *     script on the real template and feeds its output to this parser, so the
 *     two cannot drift apart unnoticed. It is a lexical read of one leaf
 *     token, the same narrow contract site-gate-banner.js uses for its flag:
 *     a value that is not a plain git ref name matches nothing, and an
 *     unmatched value shows NO banner rather than a guessed one.
 *   - The PRODUCTION value is injected by both render paths as
 *     `window.CMS_PRODUCTION_BRANCH`, read with a real YAML parser off the
 *     config they rendered at BUILD time — before any preview patch. "Which
 *     branch is production" is site identity, and the platform never
 *     hardcodes site identity (publish-progress.js derives the same fact from
 *     the PR's base repo); this file carries no branch name at all, and
 *     e2e/admin-publishing-ux.test.js asserts that it never grows one.
 *
 * A hostname test would be shorter, and would silently disable the banner the
 * day a preview host is renamed — the exact failure this shim exists to
 * remove. So this file never reads `location`, not for the verdict and not to
 * sharpen a link either (the lint forbids both, because the second use grows
 * into the first).
 *
 * ── Where a change made here actually goes ─────────────────────────────
 * Decap's editorial workflow branches off `backend.branch` and merges back
 * into it, so on a preview a Publish updates the PREVIEW, and reaches the
 * production site only when the pull request for that branch merges. The
 * copy says exactly that, and links the pull request by its head branch — a
 * GitHub search, the one link derivable from the config alone.
 *
 * ── In flow, not fixed; first, not last ────────────────────────────────
 * Same placement rule as site-gate-banner.js: a block in normal flow at the
 * top of <body>, never a `position: fixed` overlay over Decap's own toolbar
 * (the #329 defect). It is inserted as body's first child, and
 * site-gate-banner.js inserts itself AFTER this banner when one is present,
 * so the two read in a fixed order — "you are on a branch", then "the public
 * site is gated" — whichever fetch resolves first.
 *
 * It renders before login, deliberately: the config is public and needs no
 * token, so an editor who follows a preview link sees which branch they are
 * about to edit before they authenticate into it.
