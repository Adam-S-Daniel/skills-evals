// @lane: local — pure-fs, CONSUMER-ONLY lint (parses with the `yaml` library,
// never a regex over source) asserting that no `uses:` pin a CONSUMER actually
// ships carries a trailing VERSION comment.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS — THE HALF ITS PLATFORM SIBLING CANNOT COVER
// ------------------------------------------------------------
// `e2e/action-pin-comment-lint.test.js` enforces the same invariant on the
// platform tree and on the canonical thin-caller TEMPLATES under this repo's
// examples directory. It is registered in playwright.config.js's
// PLATFORM_META_SPECS — it has to be, because it asserts against the platform's
// own workflow definitions — and playwright.config.js testIgnores every
// registered name on a CONSUMER lane. So the sibling can never run on
// adamdaniel.ai or jodidaniel.com, which between them carry the majority of the
// fleet's pinned `uses:` lines and are where an agent bumping a SHA is most
// likely to helpfully label it. A template lint proves what a site COPIED FROM;
// only a consumer-mode lint proves what a site SHIPS.
//
// This file is therefore deliberately NOT in PLATFORM_META_SPECS — the
// cms-platform#244 lesson that also keeps
// "consumer-required-context-cancellable.test.js",
// "consumer-required-check-mirrors.test.js" and
// "dependabot-theme-gem-ignored.test.js" off that list. Registering it would
// silently void it on the exact repos it exists to protect. Do not "tidy" it on.
//
// WHAT IT GUARDS TODAY: ZERO SHA PINS — AND THAT IS THE POINT, NOT A DEFECT
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The paragraph above used to claim the two consumers "between them carry the
// majority of the fleet's pinned `uses:` lines". That was FALSE, and is
// corrected here (2026-08-20) rather than deleted, because it is the exact
// failure the version-comment retirement was called for: an unmaintained
// factual claim that a reader trusts instead of re-measuring. Measured across
// all 13 repos' `origin/main` `.github` trees on 2026-08-20, counting `uses:`
// lines whose ref is a full 40-hex SHA:
//
//     cms-platform  128     skills-evals  17     _agent-guidance   16
//     agentskills    11     claude-memory-map 9  repo-settings      8
//     fastmail-actions 7    GHA-bench      5     wsl-automation     1
//     adamdaniel.ai   0     jodidaniel.com 0     (202 fleet-wide)
//
// Both consumers carry 0. All 32 of each one's `uses:` lines are cms-platform
// TAG pins (`…@v0.1.88`) — the carve-out shape, which `isVersionComment()`
// never reaches because the detector reads the trailing comment and not the
// ref. So this lint scans 32 files per consumer and has no SHA pin to fire on.
//
// It is kept, and is still worth its keep, as a FORWARD TRIPWIRE: the day
// either site adopts its first third-party action, that pin lands in a tree the
// platform sibling structurally cannot see (registration testIgnores it on the
// consumer lane), and a helpfully-labelled SHA would otherwise ship unguarded.
// The structural argument above is unchanged and still correct; only the
// quantitative claim was wrong. Do not delete this lint on the grounds that it
// currently matches nothing — "matches nothing today" is its steady state, and
// the `pinFiles(SITE_ROOT).length > 0` assertion below is what keeps that
// distinguishable from a lint that silently scanned no files at all.
//
// It reads only a tree a consumer really has — its own `.github` — resolved
// from SITE_ROOT, which `e2e-tests.yml` exports as `github.workspace` (the
// CONSUMER root) on the Playwright step in both the local and the preview/prod
// lane. No platform-source path appears anywhere in this file.
//
// THE INVARIANT, and why the detector parses instead of scanning lines: see
// e2e/pin-comment-rules.js. The detector is shared with the platform sibling so
// the two cannot drift apart.
//
// SKIP SEMANTICS mirror e2e/consumer-required-check-mirrors.test.js:
// `test.skip()` fires ONLY when SITE_ROOT is unset (the platform's own self-CI,
// where the platform sibling is this invariant's coverage). A genuinely
// SITE_ROOT-having run that finds no workflow files FAILS — a lint that scanned
// nothing must never read as a clean pass.
