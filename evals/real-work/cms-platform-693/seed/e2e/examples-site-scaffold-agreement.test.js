// @lane: local — the END-TO-END proof behind examples-site-pins-current.test.js.
// Hermetic: synthetic trees under os.tmpdir(), no Jekyll, no browser, NO
// NETWORK. It does spawn `bash scripts/verify-consumer-pins.sh` and `node` on
// those trees, exactly as check-platform-pin-consistency.test.js already does
// in this same lane — that is the point of the file, and the reason it is a
// SEPARATE spec from the pure-fs guard it backs.
//
// ── THE INVARIANT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   A drift shape that would red a SCAFFOLDED SITE's own consumer gate must red
//   the TEMPLATE GUARD first.
//
// One direction, deliberately. The guard is allowed to be STRICTER — a template
// `uses:@v0.1.1` reds it while the scaffolded site is clean, because
// substitute() normalises the pin on the way out; that asymmetry is the whole
// point of guarding the template a human hand-copies from (docs/SYNC.md). What
// must never happen is the other direction: guard green, new site born failing
// its own gate.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// It has happened twice. Round 1 shipped a parse-only guard that missed a
// COMPOSITE's trailing `# vX.Y.Z` comment; round 2 closed that one and missed
// the identical shape on a REUSABLE and on a `platform_ref:` line — measured on
// the pristine branch at 80d77b9: template guard exit 0, scaffolded site's
// verify-consumer-pins.sh exit 1, on a ONE-LINE template edit. Each round's
// header then presented its own gap list as complete. A prose claim about
// coverage is what failed both times, so the coverage claim now has to survive
// an executed table.
//
// The structural half of the fix (one shared rule module, `require`d by the
// guard and shelled out to by the consumer gate — see e2e/template-pin-rules.js)
// makes the two hard to split. This makes it hard to split SILENTLY: add a
// shape here whenever one is found, and a guard that stops seeing it goes red.
