// Locks the floating "Live Preview" button (#live-preview-link) to the
// ENTRY EDITOR routes. /preview/ only fills from the editor's Save
// broadcasts (preview-bridge.js), so on every other admin route — the
// login screen, the collection lists, the /workflow board — the button
// opened a canvas that can never fill (user report 2026-07-10).
//
// It is ALSO locked to collections /preview/ has a real template for
// (cms-platform#328.1). Any other collection falls back to the "posts"
// variant in theme/_layouts/preview.html and renders a generic dark blog
// article — nothing like the entry actually is. A wrong preview is worse
// than none (it teaches distrust of the real one), so those collections
// get no button at all.
//
// The gating is a style.display toggle, NOT DOM removal, on purpose:
// cms-link-crawler.spec.js harvests every `a[href]` regardless of
// visibility (the /preview/ href must stay crawlable), and
// cms-native-view-live.spec.js excludes the anchor by id — both keep
// working only while the anchor stays in the DOM. React is untouched
// either way: the anchor is our own static shell markup, not Decap's.

// It also carries the two #328 PRODUCT-COPY locks for this surface, because
// this is the file that already knows the show/hide rule the copy has to be
// true of:
//
//   #328.5 — the floating button's `title`. It vanished on every non-editor
//     route with nothing anywhere explaining why, and its old tip described
//     only the Save mechanic. The title must now say what the button DOES and
//     WHEN it is available, and both halves must stay true of the gating
//     asserted above.
//   #328.2 — /preview/'s empty state. The bridge streams from the editor
//     tab's Save broadcasts, so a fresh load of the preview tab (an ordinary
//     RELOAD included) has nothing to show. The old copy described that
//     accurately and read, to a non-technical owner who had just reloaded, as
//     her content having vanished. The reassurance sentence is the fix, so it
//     is the thing worth locking: it is one "tighten the copy" edit away from
//     being deleted as redundant, and its absence is silent.
