// @lane: local — pure-fs lint over platform-prerelease-guard.yml and
// platform-pin-consistency.yml, asserting each workflow's `yaml`-parser
// install stays scoped to the PLATFORM checkout (`.cms-platform/`) and never
// reads the consumer root's `package.json`.
/*
 * Regression test for the 2026-09-08 incident.
 *
 * Both reusables used to install `yaml` with a plain
 * `npm install --no-save --no-package-lock yaml@2.9.1`, run from the
 * CONSUMER repo root (no `--prefix`). npm resolves the ENTIRE dependency
 * tree of whatever `package.json` sits at its prefix, so an install at the
 * consumer root doesn't just fetch `yaml` — it re-resolves every
 * devDependency the consumer happens to declare, and `--no-package-lock`
 * forces that resolution straight from the registry, bypassing the
 * lockfile that pins those devDependencies to versions already known to
 * work. That silently couples a platform-pin guard's exit code to packages
 * it has nothing to do with.
 *
 * It stopped being theoretical on 2026-09-08: decap-cms-lib-util@3.8.1 was
 * published with unresolved pnpm `catalog:` specifiers in its manifest.
 * npm exited `EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL` trying to resolve them, and because
 * both `platform-prerelease-guard.yml` and `platform-pin-consistency.yml`
 * installed `yaml` at the consumer root, that one broken upstream publish
 * turned BOTH — both REQUIRED status checks — red on every adamdaniel.ai
 * PR, blocking every editorial publish until the install moved.
 *
 * The fix is `npm install --prefix .cms-platform ...`. `.cms-platform/` is
 * the sparse platform checkout these workflows already create to fetch the
 * guard scripts, and it carries no `package.json` of its own, so npm
 * resolves `yaml` and nothing else. Both scripts' `loadYaml()` already
 * probe `path.resolve(__dirname, "..", "node_modules")` — i.e.
 * `.cms-platform/node_modules` from `.cms-platform/scripts/` — so no
 * script logic needed to change, only where the install lands.
 *
 * This lint parses the workflow YAML with the real parser — never a regex
 * or line scan over the file (AGENTS.md) — via workflow-yaml-utils'
 * `runScripts()`, which returns every `run:` block off the parsed tree.
 * Matching a flag (`--prefix`, `yaml@<version>`) WITHIN one already-
 * extracted run-block string with a regex is fine: that is lexical content
 * of a string this repo's own parser handed us, not a structural read of
 * the file.
