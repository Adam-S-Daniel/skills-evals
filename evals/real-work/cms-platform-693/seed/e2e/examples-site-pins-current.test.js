// platform pins (NO Jekyll build, NO browser, NO network, no child process).
// Runs in self-ci.yml's node-unit-lints lane (picked up automatically — that
// lane builds its spec list by EXCLUSION, so only a build-dependent lint ever

//
// ── WHAT ROTTED ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `examples/site` is the tree `scaffold/create-site.js` copies into every NEW
// site: 33 files — 32 thin workflow callers plus `dependabot.yml`. The callers
// carry 54 platform version REFERENCES: 32 `uses: Adam-S-Daniel/cms-platform/
// …@vX.Y.Z` and 22 `with: platform_ref: vX.Y.Z`. Measured on the pre-fix tree,
// those 54 held NINE DISTINCT versions (v0.1.1 ×40, v0.1.59 ×2, v0.1.52,
// v0.1.46 ×2, v0.1.0, v0.1.6 ×2, v0.1.8 ×2, v0.1.3 ×2, v0.1.58 ×2) — up to 83
// releases stale. Nothing read those values: check-platform-pin-consistency.js
// NORMALISES `@vX.Y.Z` → `@vREF` before comparing (so it can compare pin SHAPES
// across a repo), which makes it structurally blind to them, and both real
// consumers passed at v0.1.84 against the fully-rotted template.
//
// The rot's victim is a human: docs/SYNC.md tells a maintainer to re-copy thin
// callers FROM this tree when adopting a new workflow. Hand-copy one and you
// import a v0.1.1 pin into a live consumer, which that consumer's own pin gate
// then reds — far from the cause.
//
// ── WHAT THIS GUARD PROVES, EXACTLY ───────────────────────────────────────
// Not "every version token a new site inherits" — a claim two earlier rounds
// made and measurement refuted twice. What it proves is one thing, and it is
// the thing that matters:
//
//   Every template WORKFLOW file — as written, AND as `substitute()` would
//   rewrite it into a new site — is clean under the SAME rules the consumer's
//   own `scripts/verify-consumer-pins.sh` applies. Not equivalent rules. The
//   same code: RULE A is `scripts/stale-platform-refs.js`, the module that
//   script's stale-pin check literally runs, `require`d here; RULE B parses,
//   mirroring the checker that script shells out to.
//
// The consequence is the property that was missing: a drift shape that would
// red a scaffolded site's gate reds THIS lint first, on the platform PR that
// introduced it. Rounds 1 and 2 shipped a re-derived parse-only detector and
// each time a NEW spelling split the two — a composite's trailing comment, then
// a reusable's, then a `platform_ref:` line's. See e2e/template-pin-rules.js for
// why two rules replace that enumeration, and
// examples-site-scaffold-agreement.test.js for the end-to-end proof (it
// scaffolds from a DRIFTED template and runs the real shell gate on the result).
//
// ── THE CONTRACTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   1. `plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` versions agree.
//   2. FLOOR: every template workflow yields at least one platform `uses:` ref.
//   3. Every template workflow, AS WRITTEN, is clean under Rule A ∪ Rule B.
//   4. Every template workflow, AS `substitute()` WOULD EMIT IT, likewise —
//      the bytes a new site actually receives, scanned by the scanner that
//      site's own gate will run.
//   5. `substitute()` is ANCHORED to the platform slug: it rewrites a platform
//      `@vX.Y.Z` — in ANY owner casing — and leaves every other `@vX.Y.Z` alone.
//   6. `scaffold/create-site.js`'s `PLATFORM_VERSION` fallback equals
//      `v<version>` — the value an OFFLINE scaffold stamps into every pin.
//   7. `scaffold/README.md` names no platform version but the canonical one.
//   8. AGENTS.md's "Current release: `vX.Y.Z` (`v0.1.0`–`vX.Y.Z` are tagged"
//      sentence names the canonical version in BOTH positions.
//
// Contract 3 also rejects a MIS-CASED platform slug (`adam-s-daniel/…`, which
// GitHub happily resolves) outright, with "fix the casing" rather than a version
// remedy. That is a rule about ref IDENTITY, not another version position: every
// case-sensitive tool downstream — the pin checker's classifyUses(), the
// consumer gate's slug test, platform-bump.yml's `\Q…\E` rewrite — silently
// stops version-checking such a ref, so the one tree we own must refuse it. It
// replaces the accidental coverage the old "no third-party @vX.Y.Z" test gave
// this shape, and it closes it for `@main` / `@v1` too, which that test never
// reached.
//
// ── (4) AND (5): THE sub() HAZARD, FIXED AT THE TRANSFORM ─────────────────
// `substitute()`'s pin rule used to be version-shaped rather than
// cms-platform-scoped, so it clobbered ANY `@vX.Y.Z` in the file text —
// `- run: pip install some-tool@v2.3.4` shipped as `some-tool@v0.1.84` into
// every new site, seen by nothing (measured: guard 0, actionlint 0, new site's
// own gate 0, and the site broken). Round 2 answered it with a lint listing the
// positions where that could happen; `run:` was not on the list. The transform
// is now anchored, which removes the hazard rather than enumerating it, and
// contract 5 tests the TRANSFORM's behaviour instead of the template's contents
// — so it stays true no matter what a future caller contains.
//
// ── WHY plugin.json IS THE CANONICAL SOURCE ───────────────────────────────
// It is already locked at both ends: to its twin manifest by
// plugin-manifests.test.js, and to the git tag by release.yml (which REFUSES to
// cut a tag disagreeing with the manifests). AGENTS.md's "Current release:" line
// is PROSE, so it is a guarded COPY of that value (contract 8), never the
// anchor itself.
//
// ── WHY THIS CANNOT DEADLOCK A RELEASE ────────────────────────────────────
// It compares IN-REPO VALUES ONLY and never resolves a ref, so a release PR may
// legitimately pin a tag that does not exist yet: bump the manifests, the
// template and the scaffolder together in that one PR and this lint goes green
// BEFORE the tag is cut (verified against an unpublished version). The
// deadlocking alternative — asserting against the LATEST PUBLISHED release — is
// deliberately rejected: vNEXT would be unpublishable and the lint would take a
// network dependency and stop being deterministic.
//
// ── NON-DEGRADATION ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A lint that silently finds NOTHING passes vacuously — the failure mode
// `--require-canonical` was added to check-platform-pin-consistency.js to close.
// So contract 2 asserts a structural FLOOR, and contract 3 additionally asserts
// it walked a non-zero number of refs.
//
// ── OUTSIDE THE CONTRACT (measured; deliberate; NOT claimed complete) ──────
// This list is what has been MEASURED to fall outside, not a proof that nothing
// else does — the last two rounds each shipped a "complete" gap list that the
// next measurement refuted, so it is not claimed again here. Both entries are
// outside the CONSUMER GATE too, which is why they do not split the two:
//
//   • `examples/site/.github/dependabot.yml` — not a workflow, so neither this
//     lint's read set nor `verify-consumer-pins.sh`'s scan set (platform.lock /
//     Gemfile* / .github/workflows) covers it. Its three tokens are incident
//     prose today; `substitute()` rewrites neither shape it uses, so a stale
//     `versions:` entry would reach a new site unrewritten and unseen at both
//     ends.
//   • A THIRD-PARTY `uses:` pinned to a full semver is no longer an offence
//     here, and that is a deliberate substitution rather than a lost control.
//     It was only ever an offence because `substitute()`'s version-shaped rule
//     would clobber it; the rule is anchored now, so `actions/checkout@v5.0.0`
//     ships verbatim (measured) and there is nothing left to catch. Contract 5
//     replaced it by testing the TRANSFORM directly — which also covers the
//     `run:`-line position the old template-content test structurally could not
//     see, and is the reason the hazard is closed rather than enumerated.
//   • Rule A's LINE predicate is slug-cased (its `platform_ref` /
//     `cms-platform-theme` / `tag:` clauses are not), inherited from the
//     consumer gate it is shared with. Contract 3 refusing a mis-cased `uses:`
//     covers the shape that matters; a mis-cased slug in some OTHER line
//     position, carrying a stale token, would be seen by neither. Unmeasured
//     shapes may exist — two rounds of "these are the gaps" were refuted by the
//     next measurement, so this list is what has been measured, not a proof of
//     completeness. The end-to-end table in
//     examples-site-scaffold-agreement.test.js is what actually holds the line.
