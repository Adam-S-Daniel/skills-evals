/*
 * Single source of truth for each real-prod loop's *self-churn* set —
 * the paths a loop's own specs mutate and that Decap then auto-merges
 * back to `main` as a normal part of running the loop. The
 * `.github/actions/cms-recursion-gate` composite calls `shouldRunLoop()`
 * to decide, on a `push` to main, whether the push is the loop feeding
 * itself (every changed file ∈ this set ⇒ SKIP) or carries a real
 * machinery change (anything else ⇒ RUN).
 *
 * Why this replaces the old `publish: ` head-commit guard: the guard
 * assumed every loop merge lands via cms-editorial-workflow.yml's
 * `enablePullRequestAutoMerge` `commitHeadline: "publish: …"`. It does
 * not. Decap's synchronous "Publish Now" squash and its git-data-API
 * delete land the canary on `main` with Decap's own
 * `Update {{collection}} "{{slug}}"` / `Delete …` template — no
 * `publish: ` prefix — so the guard never matched and the loop re-fired
 * itself (e.g. cms-unpublish-republish.spec.js's
 * `_posts/2024-01-02-e2e-unpublish-canary.md` merges land as
 * `Update Post "…"`). A changed-files gate is message-format
 * independent and also closes the symmetric latent false-skip the
 * message guard had on a real `publish: ` squash that also touched
 * machinery.
 *
 * Keep each entry annotated with the spec that churns it; the
 * cross-check in e2e/cms-recursion-churn.test.js asserts every spec's
 * FIXTURE_PATH is covered so this can't silently drift.

// THREE prod loops fired on the same push, and because they share the

// a co-arriving sibling), media-roundtrip's heavy job was CANCELLED outright
// (run 31185014802) while host-loop's survived. #70's disjoint-push-trigger fix
