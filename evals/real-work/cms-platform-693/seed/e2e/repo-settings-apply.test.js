// @lane: local — pure-fs lint for repo-settings-apply.yml (#172 deferral 1).
//
// This is the ONLY workflow in the fleet that holds a credential able to
// rewrite repo settings and rulesets across two owners, so its safety
// properties are asserted rather than assumed. Five of them are traps that
// look fine until the day they matter:
//
//  1. The plan must run UNGATED and the gated apply GATED. An environment gate
//     pauses a job before its first step, so a plan printed inside the gated
//     job is invisible at approval time — the reviewer would approve an unseen
//     diff.
//  2. The plan's token must be mint-time scoped to `administration=read`. That
//     makes the ungated job incapable of writing, rather than trusted not to.
//  3. The gated apply must VERIFY the environment carries a required_reviewers
//     rule. Naming an environment that does not exist does not fail — GitHub
//     creates it implicitly with NO protection rules, silently turning a
//     human-gated apply into an unattended one.
//  4. The two apply lanes must be mutually exclusive, and the UNGATED one must
//     pass `--refuse-weakening` — so a wrong `if:` costs a red job rather than
//     an unattended write that reduced protection.
//  5. The concurrency group must be PER OWNER. A constant group across a
//     two-leg matrix makes the legs cancel each other, non-deterministically,
//     on every run.
//
// PLATFORM-INTERNAL: reads .github/workflows + .github/actions + scripts/,
// absent on a consumer.
