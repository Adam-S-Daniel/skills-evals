// @lane: local — pure-fs lint of workflow YAML; no browser, no network
/*
 * THE INVARIANT: a `${{ … }}` expression must never be expanded into text
 * that is later PARSED as code — neither a `run:` shell body nor an
 * `actions/github-script` `with.script` JS body.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A SUBSTITUTION SINK, NOT A VARIABLE. The runner expands
 * `${{ … }}` into the command TEXT before bash (or the github-script
 * eval) ever sees it. So the value is not data — it is source. Measured:
 * a `base.ref` of `evil$(id -un)x` interpolated into
 *
 *     git fetch --no-tags origin "${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}"
 *
 * renders as `git fetch --no-tags origin "evil$(id -un)x"` and bash runs
 * the `$(id -un)` — INSIDE the double quotes, no quote-breaking needed.
 * Binding the same value through `env:` and writing `"$BASE_REF"` leaves
 * the command text byte-identical whatever the value is, which is why
 * `env:` (shell) / `process.env` (github-script) is the fix and this lint
 * has no "quote it harder" escape hatch.
 *
 * The charset really does permit it: `git check-ref-format` accepts
 * `$( )`, backticks, `;`, `|`, `&` in a branch name, and `${IFS}`
 * substitutes for the space that IS rejected. A PR `number` (integer) and
 * a `head.sha` (40 hex) cannot carry a metacharacter, so those sinks are
 * hygiene rather than a live hole — but they are indistinguishable from
 * the dangerous shape at review time, and all of them are one `env:` line
 * from being safe. Hence: default-deny on the SHAPE.
 *
 * ── ARM 1 — `run:` bodies ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Red on any interpolation that REFERENCES `github.event`,
 * `github.head_ref` or `github.base_ref` — the attacker-authored free
 * strings — in ANY spelling. The question asked is structural ("does this
 * expression reference attacker-influenced context at all"), so the
 * matcher lexes expression PATHS rather than testing expression text
 * (see `contextPaths`). `github.event_name` is a closed enum the runner
 * sets, in use today (repo-settings-audit.yml, secrets-scan.yml and the
 * loop workflows), and must stay unflagged; segment-wise
 * comparison is what keeps it unflagged in every spelling, rather than
 * the trailing dot of a substring match.
 *
 * …plus `env.*` and `matrix.*`, the two LAUNDERING contexts — a value
 * bound there is whatever the workflow put in it, and `env:` is the fix
 * this very file recommends. See UNSAFE_ROOTS for the measurement.
 *
 * ── WHERE THE GUARANTEE ENDS — READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING ARM 1 ───────
 *
 * ARM 1 MATCHES A ROOT **NAME SET**, NOT DATAFLOW. The runner's real
 * danger property is *"an expression result is substituted into text that
 * is then parsed as code"* — that is a dataflow question, and this lint
 * does not do dataflow and is not going to. Four rounds of adversarial
 * work closed WHERE the expression sits (parsed bodies, not source
 * lines), HOW it is spelled (lexed path segments, not expression text)
 * and WHERE it ends (a lexed occurrence boundary, not the first `}}`);
 * each of those three is now general by construction. THE ROOT SET IS THE
 * ONE AXIS THAT REMAINS AN APPROXIMATION, and adding two more names to it
 * keeps it a list of names.
 *
 * So, plainly: **a dangerous value laundered through a root outside the
 * set will not be caught here.** Deliberately outside it are
 * `github.run_id` and `github.repository` (runner-set), `needs.*`,
 * `inputs.*`, and `steps.*.outputs.*`. That is NOT a claim that those
 * classes are inherently safe — a step output is only ever as closed as
 * the step that produced it, and `e2e/select-specs.js` demonstrably does
 * `specs.add(f)` on a changed FILE NAME. Each current site was traced to a
 * closed value space individually (see docs/CI-INVARIANTS.md, "Workflow
 * interpolation sinks"), and `steps.*.outputs.*` keeps its own dedicated
 * coverage in deploy-preview-cms-slug.test.js, which this lint does NOT
 * subsume. Do not delete that guard.
 *
 * Why `env`/`matrix` were added and those five were not is a COST call,
 * not a principle: the two additions have zero live sites, so they close a
 * shape for free, and `env` is where the file's own HOWTO tells you to put
 * the dangerous value. The five have live, individually-traced sites. A
 * new site under any of them owes the trace again — this lint will not ask
 * for it. Widening further is legitimate; claiming the list is complete is
 * not.
 *
 * ── ARM 2 — `actions/github-script` `with.script` bodies ─────────────
 * Red on ANY interpolation. A github-script body is JS handed to an eval;
 * every dynamic value it needs is already reachable through `process.env`
 * or `context`, which is how 18 of the repo's 20 github-script steps (and
 * all of the composite actions) already read theirs. There is no value
 * class that needs to arrive as source text, so this arm has no allowlist
 * of "safe" expressions — the shape itself is the defect.
 *
 * SCOPE. Only `run:` and `with.script` bodies. `if:`, `env:` and every
 * other `with:` key are runner-EXPRESSION contexts (the value never
 * becomes code), so binding a value there is the fix, not the bug — and
 * scanning them would make the fix un-expressible.
 *
 * WAIVER (default-deny + inline escape hatch). An occurrence is permitted
 * only when `# injection-allow: <reason>` sits on its own source line or
 * the line immediately above. The window is matched against ABSOLUTE FILE
 * lines, not the extracted body array: a one-line plain `run:` scalar puts
 * its interpolation at body offset 0, so a body-relative "line above"
 * check cannot see the comment at the only place it fits — above the
 * `run:` key — and the waiver would silently fail to apply (measured).
 * An `env:` binding READ BACK AS A SHELL VARIABLE needs no waiver: `"$NAME"`
 * removes the `${{ }}` from the body entirely, into a map this lint does
 * not scan. Reading it back as an EXPRESSION — `"${{ env.NAME }}"` — does
 * not; that is the sink again with an extra hop, and arm 1 flags it. The
 * distinction is the whole fix: `$` vs `${{`, not where the value came
 * from. (This sentence used to say a binding needs no waiver full stop.
 * That was FALSE whenever the body read it back, and the false version
 * shipped while the exact shape it blessed passed both gates at exit 0.)

// The attacker-authored free strings, as folded segment paths — plus the two
// LAUNDERING contexts, whose values are whatever the workflow bound into them.
//
// `env` is here because it is THE FIX THIS FILE RECOMMENDS, and the fix is the
// `env:` KEY, not the `env` CONTEXT. Binding `BASE: ${{ …base.ref }}` and
// reading `"$BASE"` leaves the command text byte-identical; binding the same
// value and reading `${{ env.BASE }}` re-opens the identical sink, because the
// runner substitutes the branch name into the command TEXT either way. Both
// halves look individually blessed — the binding is the HOWTO, and reading it
// back is "just a variable" — which is exactly why it is the shape the next
// real sink will wear. Measured in `visual-regression.yml`'s `Fetch base ref`,
// its `run:` respelled as `git fetch --no-tags origin "${{ env.BASE }}"`:
// this lint exit 0 (`hits: []`) and actionlint v1.7.7 exit 0.
//
// AND ACTIONLINT IS NO BACKSTOP HERE EITHER — measured on a field on its OWN
// untrusted-input list, in that same step: `run: … "${{ …pull_request.title }}"`
// exits 1 (*"github.event.pull_request.title" is potentially untrusted*), while
// `env: {T: ${{ …title }}}` + `run: … "${{ env.T }}"` exits 0 and says nothing.
// It models `env` as a live resolvable context inside `run:` (`${{ env.ANY }}`
// type-checks at exit 0), so the expansion is real; it simply has no dataflow
// rule. One `env:` hop launders a value straight off its own list.
//
// `matrix` is the same laundering shape without the irony: a matrix value is
// only as closed as whatever built it, and a DYNAMIC matrix
// (`fromJSON(needs.x.outputs.y)`) can carry anything. It is not the fix this

// elsewhere in the tree (`e2e-tests.yml`'s `PW_PROJECT: ${{ matrix.project }}`,
// `repo-settings-apply.yml`'s `OWNER: ${{ matrix.owner }}`), but only in `env:`
// / `with:` / `name:` — runner-expression keys this lint does not scan, i.e.
// the fix, which stays expressible. Every `env.` inside a code body is
// JavaScript `process.env.X`, not a `${{ }}` span, so it never reaches the path
// lexer at all (and would lex as head `process` if it did).

// ── PERMANENT REGRESSION CANARY — the three evasion axes ─────────────
//
// Synthetic workflow text driven through `offenders()`, the SHIPPED
// detector rather than a copy of it. Pure string in / hits out: no fs,
// no network, no clock.
//
// It guards three defects that each shipped past an earlier version of
// this spec, and each let the SAME live, charset-injectable `base.ref`
// sink in visual-regression.yml's `Fetch base ref` step through BOTH this
// lint and actionlint at exit 0:
//
//   1. WHERE the expression sits. A `${{ }}` written across a source line
//      break substitutes at runtime exactly as if it sat on one line, but
//      the per-line scan then in place matched neither half. Reverting
//      `scan()` to iterate body lines turns those cases green again.
//   2. HOW the expression is SPELLED. Index syntax, mixed dot-and-index,
//      insignificant whitespace and CASE are documented, runtime-identical
//      spellings of the same dot path, and the `/github\.event\./` text
//      regex then in place saw none of them. Reverting `runUnsafe` to that
//      regex turns those cases green again.
//   3. WHERE the expression ENDS. A `}}` inside a single-quoted literal is
//      DATA, so the non-greedy `/\$\{\{[\s\S]*?\}\}/g` then in place cut
//      the span at the literal and never saw the reference behind it.
//      Reverting `interpolations()` to that regex turns those cases green
//      again.
//
// All three axes COMPOSE — an index-form expression also split across
// lines is a case of its own below, and so is a literal-brace one — which
// is the argument for matching parsed bodies, lexed occurrence boundaries
// and lexed path segments instead of enumerating spellings. Each
// enumeration has lost to the next spelling; the case form below is the one
// that a draft closing only the three spellings named in review still let
// through (measured), and the literal-brace form is the one that survived
// the round that closed every spelling.
//
// The control cases carry as much weight as the red ones: an `env:`-bound
// value, a properly waived line, `github.event_name` in EVERY spelling, a
// path quoted inside a string literal, a literal `}}` in front of a SAFE
// reference, and the safe `github.*` members must all stay SILENT, or the
// canary would also pass on a detector that just flagged everything.
