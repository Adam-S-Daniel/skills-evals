// @lane: local — pure-fs/pure-Node lint. No browser, no network, no build.
//
// THE INVARIANT (#283): a workflow that names a version TWICE must name the
// SAME version both times.
//
// A caller of a cms-platform reusable carries the platform version as a
// dependency ref (`uses: …@vX.Y.Z`) AND as an input value
// (`with: platform_ref: vX.Y.Z`). Dependabot's `github-actions` ecosystem moves
// the first and structurally cannot move the second. The skew that leaves is
// worse than a crash: the NEW reusable runs against the OLD script its stale
// `platform_ref` sparse-checks out, an argv-scanning `flag()` ignores flags it
// does not know, and the job reports GREEN having done none of the work the new
// workflow asked for. Seven fleet repos sat a release behind on exactly that
// pair while one of them accumulated fourteen unreported failing
// default-branch push runs.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE COVERS, AND WHY IT IS SPLIT THE WAY IT IS
//   - the pure checker (`scripts/check-pin-agreement.js`) against SYNTHETIC
//     workflows, including the exact #283 shape and the alias/merge-key shapes
//     a regex is blind to. This is the part that proves the lint DISCRIMINATES:
//     a check nothing can make fail is not a check.
//   - the REAL trees this repo owns — the `examples/site` thin-caller templates
//     (where every one of these pairs actually lives) and this repo's own
//     workflows — so a template bumped by halves reds here.
//   - the delivery: the `pin-agreement.yml` reusable's shape, because the whole
//     point of #283 is reaching repos with no harness, and the reusable is the
//     only thing that reaches them.
//
// PLATFORM-INTERNAL, and registered in PLATFORM_META_SPECS: it reads the
// platform `scripts/` tree, this repo's own workflow definitions and the
// `examples/site` templates, none of which a consumer ships. That is the
// OPPOSITE call to its sibling `e2e/consumer-automerge-nudge-contexts.test.js`,
// and deliberately so — this lint's subject is the platform's own tree, so
// being testIgnored on a consumer lane costs it nothing.
