/*
 * Pure builders for the EPHEMERAL, born-published, hard-deleted per-run
 * prod-loop posts (#1771 step 4).
 *
 * Why this module exists
 * ----------------------
 * The prod-mutation (`cms-publish-loop-prod-mutate.spec.js`) and media
 * round-trip (`cms-media-roundtrip.spec.js`) loops used to mutate a
 * single PERSISTENT committed `_posts/` fixture in place — toggle
 * `published`, edit the body, then revert. A transient failure on the
 * revert leg left that one shared cell corrupted on `main`, and because
 * the next run re-derived its baseline from the same on-disk body, the
 * corruption was self-perpetuating (#1771 incident run 26511130712).
 *
 * Step 4 removes the *class* of bug by construction: each run now
 * CREATES a uniquely-pathed post, publishes it, asserts it serves, then
 * DELETES it — resting state is ABSENCE (404), and absence has no
 * corrupt variant. A killed run leaks at most ONE inert, uniquely-named
 * orphan (swept by `sweep-stale-cms-prs.yml`), never a shared mutable
 * baseline. The path/body are a pure function of the runId; nothing ever
 * reads a path it also writes (the #1771 invariant).
 *
 * Born-published + future-dated (the canonical `composePost` text):
 *   - `published: true` from creation — the loop never toggles a
 *     persistent file; it creates a live post and deletes it.
 *   - date `2099-12-31` so the post serves the SAME way the old
 *     `2099-01-01` canary did under `_config.yml`'s `future: true`
 *     (Jekyll skips future-dated posts unless `future: true`; the old
 *     canaries relied on exactly that). `2099-12-31` sorts last and is
 *     trivially unique-by-runId in the slug, so it can't collide with a
 *     real post or another in-flight run.
 *   - `robots: noindex,nofollow` + `sitemap: false` so a born-published
 *     post that briefly serves mid-run never leaks into search.
 *   - `test_fixture: true` marks it as automated test content, like the
 *     old committed canaries. (It is NOT what hides the post from the
 *     admin Posts list: `theme/admin/posts-list-enhance.js` hides by DOM,
 *     from the `e2e-` filename and `E2E ` title patterns, and the
 *     `test_fixture` list filter is opt-in.)
 *
 * The UI-created post carries the same three markers (#531). The PRIMARY
 * create leg is genuinely UI-driven — the spec types Title/URL Slug/Date/Body
 * into Decap's "+ New Post" form and toggles Published — but the `posts`
 * collection declares no `sitemap`/`robots` widget and its `test_fixture` is
 * `widget: hidden, default: false`, so the form alone would land
 * `test_fixture: false` and NO `sitemap`/`robots` on `main`: a born-published
 * post served WITHOUT a noindex tag. So before Save, each spec that creates a
 * production post calls `markEphemeralTestPost` (e2e/cms-editor-ui.js), which
 * registers a Decap `preSave` listener stamping TEST_POST_MARKERS onto exactly
 * that entry — through Decap's own save path, the same public API
 * admin/slug-pin.js uses. Decap serializes every key in an entry's data, so the
 * markers also survive a later edit of the same file.
 * e2e/prod-test-post-markers.test.js lint-locks the call.
 *
 * The `e2e-` slug is still the load-bearing exclusion signal for feeds,
 * listings and cross-posting (e2e/public-content.js `isTestFixturePost`,
 * theme `exclude_e2e_posts.rb`), because a run killed before #531 (or an
 * orphan the sweeper has not reaped yet) can still carry the unmarked shape.
 *
 * The body marker IS the runId (structural, in the slug AND the body) so
 * a Slate `widget: markdown` round-trip on the body can't strip the
 * run-identity the assertions match on — and since the post is deleted,
 * any body churn is thrown away with it.
 *
 * Pure Node — no `require("./base")` — so it stays a plain, unit-testable
 * library (same discipline as `./fixture-baseline`).
