// Locks the two halves of issue #13 so the automated down-sync can't regress
// to a state that either (a) can't push or (b) produces a PR that fails the
// single-version pin-consistency guard (#29):
//
//   1. PUSH AUTH — the bump rewrites `.github/workflows/*` (the `uses:@` pins +
//      `platform_ref:` inputs), so the push needs `workflows` permission. The
//      default Actions GITHUB_TOKEN's App lacks it, so the checkout MUST use the
//      App installation token as the persisted push credential (the
//      `secrets.gh_token` PAT fallback was removed in v0.1.103).
//      Without it: "refusing to allow a GitHub App to ... update workflow ...
//      without 'workflows' permission" → the whole bump fails.
//   2. ATOMIC BUMP — the bump must move EVERY pinned reference in one PR, not
//      just `platform_ref:`: the `uses:@<tag>` pins, the `cms-platform-theme`
//      Gemfile `tag:`, and `Gemfile.lock` (`tag:` + git `revision:`). A
//      `platform_ref:`-only PR fails pin-consistency until Dependabot's piecemeal
//      PRs land. So the run script must resolve the release COMMIT sha and
//      rewrite the Gemfile / Gemfile.lock revision too.
