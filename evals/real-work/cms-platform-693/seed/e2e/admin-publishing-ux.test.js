// @lane: local — pure-fs static invariants on the publishing-UX staged plan (phases 2-5).
//
// docs/PUBLISHING-UX.md §4 stages the fix for a product in which an editor
// meets NINE overlapping notions of "published" across four systems. Phase 1
// shipped the state bar; phases 2-5 are:
//
//   2  one door        — hide the Status dropdown and the Workflow board on
//                        the PRODUCTION shell, so Publish is the only route
//                        to production (one-door-publish.js);
//   3  one button      — replace Decap's split Publish control with a
//                        platform-owned button (publish-button.js);
//   4  a real progress state — poll the entry's own PR so the invisible
//                        5-15 minutes stops being a silence
//                        (publish-progress.js), and suppress Decap's false
//                        "Failed to publish" toast;
//   5  one vocabulary  — four badges + two modifiers, derived once
//                        (entry-status-model.js) and rendered by both the
//                        editor bar and the collection list, plus the
//                        site-level gate banner (site-gate-banner.js) and,
//                        since #412, the branch-binding banner
//                        (branch-binding-banner.js) that says which branch
//                        a preview admin is bound to.
//
// This is the cheap pure-fs half — no browser, no build, no network. The
// behavioural half is e2e/admin-one-door.spec.js and the model's own unit
// tests in e2e/entry-status-model.test.js (which are the ones that can
// actually exercise the logic, and were proved able to fail by inverting the
// model's precedence).
//
// Registered in PLATFORM_META_SPECS: it reads the platform's theme/admin
// SOURCE tree and BOTH render paths (scripts/render-decap-config.rb and the
// gem hook), none of which a consumer has in that position — the same
// reasoning that registers admin-shim-load-order.test.js and
// admin-329-shims.test.js.
