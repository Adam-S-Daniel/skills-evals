// @lane: local — pure-fs lint (no browser, no build, no network) over this
// repo's TWO plugin manifests and the skills they publish.
//
// WHY THIS LINT LIVES HERE AND NOT IN `adam-agentskills`. `skills/` ships as a
// FEDERATED bundle in the `adam-agentskills` marketplace: the marketplace ENTRY
// lives in that repo, but its source is
// `{"source":"github","repo":"Adam-S-Daniel/cms-platform"}` with NO
// subdirectory path — so THIS repo's root is the plugin root, and the
// manifests plus every `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` are files only this repo can
// see. `adam-agentskills` validates its own bundles' manifests in its own CI and
// structurally cannot reach these. If this repo doesn't lint them, nothing
// does: both repos stay green while the pair drifts.
//
// THE TWO-MANIFEST MODEL (mirrors the fleet shape in `adam-agentskills`)
//   .claude-plugin/plugin.json   Claude Code
//   plugin.json  (repo root)     Agent Plugins 1.0.0 — Codex >= 0.147.0,
//                                VS Code, Cursor, Copilot
// Claude Code is not an Agent Plugins conformant client and reads only the
// first; the conformant clients read only the second. They coexist rather than
// one replacing the other, which is exactly what makes `name` and `version` —
// carried twice, by hand — a standing drift hazard: bump one, forget the
// other, and the client reading the stale copy reports the wrong plugin
// forever. Hence the cross-check below, which is the same contract
// `adam-agentskills`' scripts/check_agent_plugins.py enforces for its own bundles.
//
// WHY `version` IS PRESENT AT ALL, AND WHAT KEEPS IT HONEST. A manifest with
// no `version` is the single warning that makes `claude plugin validate
// --strict` FAIL. The value tracks AGENTS.md's "Current release:" — and it
// shipped WRONG the first time (both manifests declared 0.1.82 inside the
// v0.1.83 change that introduced them, and nothing existed to correct it). Two
// locks now, deliberately at different ends: this file locks the two copies to
// EACH OTHER, and `.github/workflows/release.yml` refuses to cut a tag whose
// version the manifests disagree with, which locks them to the TAG. The release
// job cannot rewrite-and-push them instead — `main` is PR-only by ruleset — so
// the bump belongs in the release PR, reviewed alongside AGENTS.md and
// docs/VERSION-HISTORY.md.
//
// WHAT THE SKILL ITEMS ARE FOR. A frontmatter `name` that disagrees with its
// directory basename, and a `description` past the 1024-character Agent Skills
// cap, are the two defects that reached a consumer PAST a green CI. Neither is
// visible from the manifests, so they are locked here alongside them.
//
// WHY THIS FILE ALSO SCHEMA-VALIDATES THE ROOT MANIFEST. `adam-agentskills`'
// scripts/check_agent_plugins.py prints, for this bundle: "federated from
// Adam-S-Daniel/cms-platform — its Agent Plugins manifests are validated by
// that repo's own CI, not here." That sentence is a PROMISE, and this file is
// the only place that can keep it: that script validates the manifests it can
// DISCOVER (directories under its own plugins/), and a federated entry has no
// such directory. `claude plugin validate` does not close the gap either — it
// never reads the root plugin.json at all (measured 2026-08-14: a root manifest
// carrying a 2.0.0 `$schema` plus `category`/`defaultEnabled`/`skills`/
// `author.github` still exits 0). So the schema contract is asserted below.
//
// AND WHY THE self-ci LANE THAT RUNS `claude plugin validate` IS NON-STRICT.
// It is not an oversight and must not be "fixed" by deleting CLAUDE.md:
// `--strict` promotes warnings to errors, and this plugin root permanently
// emits one — "CLAUDE.md at the plugin root is not loaded as project context"
// — for a file the _agent-guidance sync owns and this repo must keep. The CLI
// is gated anyway because it is the only check that parses each
// skills/*/SKILL.md the way the runtime does (unparseable frontmatter YAML =>
// exit 1), which is the exact defect that shipped in consumer-repo-provisioning.
//
// PARSE, NEVER REGEX. The frontmatter goes through the `yaml` library (already
// an e2e devDependency). `skills/consumer-repo-provisioning/SKILL.md` writes its
// description as a `>-` folded block scalar — a regex would hand back the
// literal ">-" and then measure the wrong string against the cap, i.e. a check
// that passes while checking nothing.
//
// SKIP DISCIPLINE. PLATFORM-ONLY: the whole file skips when SITE_ROOT is set.
// On a CONSUMER lane the harness is copied to the SITE root (see
// e2e-tests.yml's local lane), so `path.resolve(__dirname, "..")` resolves to
// the consuming site, which ships none of this. The skip keys off that ONE
// named condition and never off "the file wasn't there" — a missing manifest
// is the failure this lint exists to catch, so it must never be a reason to
// go quiet.
