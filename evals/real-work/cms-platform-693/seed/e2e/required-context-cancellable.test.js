// @lane: local — PURE-FS lint over repo-settings.yml, every workflow in this
// repo, AND every thin caller under examples/site/.github/workflows; no browser,
// no build, no network. Runs in self-ci.yml's node-unit-lints lane.
//
// PLATFORM-INTERNAL, and registered as such: it reads the root repo-settings.yml
// manifest and the platform's OWN workflow DEFINITIONS, neither of which a
// consumer ships, so it is listed in playwright.config.js's PLATFORM_META_SPECS
// and testIgnore'd on every CONSUMER lane. That ignore is why it is only HALF the
// coverage: the repos where this bug actually wedges a PR are the two consumers,
// and this file cannot run there. Its CONSUMER-mode sibling
// `e2e/consumer-required-context-cancellable.test.js` — deliberately absent from
// the registry, reading `<SITE_ROOT>/.github/workflows/` and the consumer's own
// `.cms-platform/` checkout — is the half that does. Neither substitutes for the
// other: this one is the only coverage of the platform tree and the canonical
// templates, that one the only coverage of what a site actually ships.
//
// ── THE INVARIANT: NO REQUIRED CONTEXT MAY END `cancelled` ───────────────
//
// A cancelled required check is an UNBLOCKABLE merge block. GitHub's merge API
// answers
//
//     405 Required status check "<ctx>" is cancelled
//
// and NOTHING overrides it — not native auto-merge, not an explicit merge call,
// not a nudge bot, not an admin. The PR reads all-green in the UI and simply
// never lands. That is the whole reason this is a lint and not a code-review
// note: the symptom is a PR that looks fine, and the cause is one line three
// screens away, often in another repository.
//
// ── WHY THE INVARIANT IS STATED AS AN OUTCOME, NOT AS A FORBIDDEN KEY ────
//
// This file used to be `required-context-concurrency.test.js` and enforced ONE
// cause: a `concurrency` declaration governing the publishing job
// (cms-platform#285). It enforced that correctly and it is still enforced below.
// Naming the guard after one cause is what let a SECOND one ship underneath it.
//
// v0.1.87 deleted every `concurrency` group from every required-context
// publisher. Four days later, on adamdaniel.ai PRs #3202 and #3217, three
// required contexts concluded `cancelled` anyway:
//
//     #3217  preview-media / preview-media  cancelled  15:22:25Z → 15:52:45Z  30m20s
//     #3217  parity / parity                cancelled  15:22:19Z → 15:52:45Z  30m26s
//     #3202  parity / parity                cancelled  04:40:11Z → 05:10:27Z  30m16s
//
// Every one sat on a 30-minute wall, and there was no `concurrency` group within
// reach of any of them. `timeout-minutes` was the cause. What hid it is a GitHub
// quirk worth writing down: A JOB KILLED AT ITS `timeout-minutes` WALL REPORTS
// CONCLUSION `cancelled`, NOT `timed_out`. `timed_out` is already alertable in
// scripts/audit-scheduled-runs.js's BAD_CONCLUSIONS — had the API used it, that
// audit would have caught this without any of this file. cms-platform#289.
//
// SCOPE, STATED HONESTLY: neither PR was "all-green but unmergeable". Both also
// carried `e2e / e2e: failure`, so both were blocked for an ordinary reason too.
// What is DEMONSTRATED is the MECHANISM — a required context reaching `cancelled`
// with no concurrency group anywhere near it. The wedge-with-everything-else-green
// case has not been observed, and this comment does not claim it.
//
// AGGRAVATING, and the reason this is not "wait and see": deleting the groups in
// v0.1.87 increases runner QUEUEING, and queueing is charged against the same
// 30-minute wall. The #285 fix may make the #289 route MORE likely, not less.
//
// ── WHAT THIS LINT CAN SEE, AND WHAT IT CANNOT ──────────────────────────
//
// `cancellationHazards()` in required-context-cancellable-utils.js reports four
// structural causes, each readable off parsed workflow YAML:
//
//   1. `concurrency` at any of the four sites that can govern the job (#285).
//   2. `timeout-minutes` ON THE PUBLISHING JOB (#289).
//   3. `strategy.fail-fast` not explicitly false on a MATRIX publisher.
//   4. `needs:` without `always()` — the twin failure, where the gate SKIPS
//      instead of reporting and the required context hangs or never reddens.
//
// IT CANNOT SEE: a human pressing Cancel, `gh run cancel`, GitHub's 6-hour job
// and 35-day run ceilings, a runner evicted mid-job, an org-level cancellation
// policy. None of those live in the workflow text, so no static lint over that
// text can flag them. Nothing here should be read as covering them.
//
// ── WHY THE #285 CARVE-OUT WAS DROPPED (cause 1) ────────────────────────
//
// AGENTS.md states the concurrency rule twice. The categorical sentence — "a job
// that publishes a REQUIRED status context and can fire more than once on the
// same head sha gets no `concurrency` block at all" — is the headline. Four
// bullets down sits what reads as a carve-out: "Jobs triggered only by
// `push` / `synchronize` — each a new sha — are safe to cancel."
//
// An earlier version of this lint implemented the carve-out. Two independent
// findings killed it.
//
//   1. THE PREMISE IS FALSE, MEASURED IN PRODUCTION. adamdaniel.ai PR #3006
//      (2026-08-09): opened 01:57:10Z, head_ref_force_pushed 01:57:38Z, and
//      visual-regression runs 31289327061 (cancelled) and 31289327099 (skipped)
//      BOTH created 01:57:41Z carrying head_sha 68d7c777. Webhook delivery
//      latency dispatches the `opened` run AFTER the force-push has already moved
//      the head, so the two land on one SHA. And `opened`/`synchronize` cannot be
//      narrowed away: without them the required context never reports at all. So
//      NO trigger set makes a shared key collision-free.
//   2. THE TRIGGER FIX CANNOT REACH PRODUCTION; THE REUSABLE-SIDE FIX CAN.
//      `concurrency` and `timeout-minutes` both live in the PLATFORM reusable, so
//      a `platform_ref` bump carries either fix to both consumers.
//      `pull_request.types` lives in the CONSUMER's own caller, and nothing
//      propagates it — `platform-bump.yml` seeds only a WHOLLY-MISSING caller
//      (its own comment says so) and `check-platform-pin-consistency.js`'s
//      `structuralShape()` compares `permissions` + `jobs.*` with `on:`
//      deliberately excluded. A template-only `types:` change would have reached
//      neither live site while THIS lint, reading examples/site/, reported green
//      forever.
//
// So the rule enforced here has no exemptions at all, and neither does the
// timeout rule: a bigger wall only moves the number. THE COST IS REAL AND IS
// ACCEPTED — superseded runs finish instead of being cancelled, and a runaway job
// is bounded by a wall on a job whose conclusion nobody requires rather than on
// the publisher. Runner minutes are recoverable; a wedged required check has no
// operator remedy.
//
// ── WHY THIS PARSES YAML AND NEVER GREPS IT ──────────────────────────────
//
// Per AGENTS.md's standing rule, anything reasoning about workflow STRUCTURE goes
// through the real `yaml` parser via workflow-yaml-utils — a regex over source
// reads clean on structure it cannot see (an aliased `types:` list, a flow-style
// `on: [pull_request, push]`, a `concurrency:` or a `timeout-minutes:` inherited
// through a merge key). It also matters that a BARE `on:` key can parse as the
// BOOLEAN `true` under a YAML 1.1 schema, which is why the trigger value is read
// through `workflowOn()` rather than off `doc.on` alone.
