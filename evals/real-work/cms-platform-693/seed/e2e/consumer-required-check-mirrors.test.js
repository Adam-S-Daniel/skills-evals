// @lane: local — pure-fs, CONSUMER-ONLY lint (parses with the `yaml` library,
// never regex) of a live cms-platform consumer's OWN e2e required-check pair:
// `<SITE_ROOT>/.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` and `.../e2e-stub.yml`.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// `e2e / e2e` is a REQUIRED status context on a consumer's `main` ruleset (see
// repo-settings.yml, `ruleset_library.consumer-main`). The heavy Playwright
// lane carries a `paths-ignore`, so a docs-/infra-/tooling-only PR skips it —
// and a workflow excluded by `paths:` / `paths-ignore:` emits NO check run at
// all, not a neutral or a skipped one. The stub caller fires on exactly the
// complement (its `paths:` IS the heavy lane's `paths-ignore`) and emits a
// synthetic `e2e / e2e` success, which is the only reason a docs-only PR stays
// mergeable instead of parking forever on "Waiting for status to be reported".
//
// The two lists are therefore a MIRROR, and either direction of drift opens a
// hole: a PR whose files match NEITHER filter gets an `e2e / e2e` check run
// from neither workflow and hangs forever, while a PR matching BOTH needlessly
// double-reports the context. Same argument for `pull_request.types` (#145): a
// retargeted docs-only PR needs the stub to re-fire on the new base exactly
// like the heavy lane does, or the required context is withdrawn and never
// restored.
//
// Two more filters the mirror argument silently assumed but did not check:
//
//   - `pull_request.branches`. Agreeing about paths and types means nothing if
//     the two lanes disagree about which BASE they watch. Move the stub's
//     `branches` off `main` and a docs-only PR targeting `main` matches the
//     heavy lane's `paths-ignore` (no run) AND falls outside the stub's
//     `branches` (no run) — `e2e / e2e` reports from neither and the PR hangs,
//     with `paths` and `types` still perfectly mirrored.
//   - the two must use OPPOSITE filter KEYS. GitHub rejects `paths` and
//     `paths-ignore` on the SAME event, so a stub that gained a `paths-ignore`
//     beside its `paths` would never run at all — and every docs-only PR would
//     hang while the list comparison went on passing, because the list it
//     compares is still present and still correct.
//
// WHAT WAS — AND WAS NOT — COVERED BEFORE THIS FILE
// ------------------------------------------------
// `e2e/required-check-stub-paths.test.js` locks the same mirror on the PLATFORM
// TEMPLATE, the pair under this repo's own examples tree that a site copies
// from, and `test.skip`s the moment those template files are absent — which is
// every consumed checkout. Nothing checked a consumer's OWN copy once it had
// been copied away from the template. Both consumers' pairs happen to match the
// template today, so the gap was LATENT, never live; this spec closes it by
// asserting the mirror where it actually has to hold — in the repo whose branch
// protection is doing the waiting.
//
// CONSUMER ONLY, never platform. This spec reads ONLY
// `<SITE_ROOT>/.github/workflows/` — no platform-source path (not the examples
// template tree, not the repo root used as a content root) appears anywhere in
// this file. It is deliberately NOT registered in PLATFORM_META_SPECS:
// `playwright.config.js` testIgnores every registered name on a CONSUMER lane,
// so registering this one would silently void it on the exact repos it exists
// to protect. That is the cms-platform#244 lesson that shaped its sibling
// `e2e/dependabot-theme-gem-ignored.test.js`, which is unregistered for the
// same reason and whose shape this file follows.
//
// Parsing is the `yaml` library — a real parser, never a regex over workflow
// source — but deliberately NOT via `e2e/workflow-yaml-utils.js`: the meta-spec
// registry's `workflows-def` detector treats a require of that helper as an
// UNCONDITIONAL platform-internal signal, which would force this file into
// PLATFORM_META_SPECS and undo the paragraph above. `e2e/dependabot-config-utils.js`
// reaches for the library directly for exactly this reason.
//
// Skip semantics: `test.skip()` fires ONLY when SITE_ROOT is unset (the
// platform's own self-CI, where the template lint named above is the coverage
// of this invariant). A genuinely SITE_ROOT-having run whose consumer is
// missing either file FAILS — a site that ships the heavy lane without the stub
// (or the reverse) is precisely the hang this lint exists to prevent, not a
// case to wave through as "nothing to guard here".
