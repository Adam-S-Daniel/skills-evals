/*
 * Canary fixture descriptors. The publish-loop tests use these to drive
 * admin-side edits and then assert the change appears at the public URL.
 *
 * Every entry has:
 *   - `id`             — matches the `canary_id:` front-matter, used as a
 *                        DOM attribute so tests don't need to grep markup
 *   - `slug`           — the URL slug; tests can derive both the CMS
 *                        navigation path and the public URL from this
 *   - `path`           — the source-file path under `_e2e/`
 *   - `cmsCollection`  — Decap collection name (`e2e`, since canaries live
 *                        in their own system collection)
 *   - `publicPath`     — root-relative URL the public site renders at
 *   - `baseline`       — the title-line baseline body sentence; the
 *                        publish-loop spec asserts this string is live on
 *                        the public URL after cleanup. Drift in this
 *                        single sentence is what the daily canary probe
 *                        watches for.
 *   - `baselineBody`   — the FULL canonical body the cleanup step writes
 *                        back (title sentence + explanatory paragraphs +
 *                        the "no test in progress" footer). The UI
 *                        cleanup leg types this verbatim into the body
 *                        textarea (see admin/config.yml: `widget: text`
 *                        on the e2e collection body field — using
 *                        `widget: markdown` would round-trip every soft
 *                        line wrap into a paragraph break, producing
 *                        perpetually-open conflicting cms/e2e/* PRs;
 *                        see PR #882 for the case study).
 *
 * The baseline strings here MUST stay in sync with the body text in the
 * checked-in `_e2e/canary-*.md` files. The unit test
 * `e2e/canary-content.test.js` enforces that drift is caught at CI time.
