// @lane: local — asserts form hint text from the rendered _site/admin/config.yml; drives the local /admin shell
/**
 * @file e2e/cms-form-clarity.spec.js
 *
 * Locks current form hint text against drift, and documents a deferred
 * redesign proposal:
 *
 * Today: posts have a `published` boolean + a `publish_date` datetime.
 * Editors get a label + hint, but the relationship is implicit:
 *   - "Published OFF + Publish Date set" = scheduled
 *   - "Published OFF + no Publish Date" = draft
 *   - "Published ON" = live (publish_date ignored)
 *
 * Proposed: replace the boolean with a `status` select (Draft / Scheduled /
 * Published). Make `publish_date` conditionally visible only when status =
 * Scheduled. Implementation deferred to a follow-up PR — this spec just
 * locks the current state so we know when to revisit the snapshot.
