/*
 * REGISTRY — the single source of truth for the base_collections skip-guards on
 * the CONSUMER-RUNNING @admin-write / @admin-read / @admin-screenshots specs that
 * drive `/admin/index-local.html` (issue #33, CONCERN A).
 *
 * WHY (the gap PR #34's first pass missed)
 * ----------------------------------------
 * A single-page consumer that opts out of the platform's base collections via
 * `cms.base_collections: []` (v0.1.7; e.g. jodidaniel.com) renders its LOCAL-dev
 * Decap config (`_site/admin/config-local.yml`) with the posts/tags/projects/
 * pages collection blocks STRIPPED — the gem's `decap_config_hook.rb` applies the
 * keep-list deletion to BOTH config.yml AND config-local.yml (and config-local
 * has no `__SITE_COLLECTIONS__` marker, so the site's OWN custom collections
 * aren't spliced back into local-dev either — see AGENTS.md "config-local
 * single-page limitation"). So a consumer's LOCAL admin shows NO collections.
 *
 * The first #33 pass guarded the read-only / config / served-content specs but
 * NOT the ~dozen @admin-write/@admin-read/@admin-screenshots specs that navigate
 * `/admin/index-local.html#/collections/{posts,projects,pages,tags}/...` or wait
 * for the posts/tags/projects/pages SIDEBAR LINK. On a `base_collections: []`
 * consumer every one of those would time out (the link / route never appears) —
 * permanently RED. This registry guards each PRECISELY.
 *
 * KEY SIGNAL CHOICE — build-INDEPENDENT SOURCE signal
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * These specs drive `index-local.html` → `config-local.yml`. We key the skip on
 * `site-capabilities.keepsBaseCollection(siteRoot, name)`, which reads the
 * consumer's `_config.yml` `cms.base_collections` keep-list — a pure SOURCE read
 * that needs NO Jekyll build. So the guard resolves correctly even in a lane
 * where `_site/` isn't built (and matches the gem's deletion: a name absent from
 * the keep-list is the name the hook strips from config-local).
 *
 * PRECISION — each spec is guarded on EXACTLY the collection(s) it exercises:
 *   - mode "all": skip unless ALL listed collections are kept. Used by specs that
 *     hard-assert the whole base sidebar (posts AND tags AND projects AND pages).
 *     A consumer that keeps posts but drops pages must still skip — the spec would
 *     fail on the missing pages link otherwise.
 *   - mode "any" (a single-element list is the common case): skip unless the one
 *     collection the spec drives is kept.
 *
 * HOW A NEW GENERIC-COLLECTION SPEC MUST REGISTER (drift lock)
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * Any NEW consumer-running spec that drives `/admin/index-local.html` and
 * navigates `#/collections/<base>` or waits for a base-collection sidebar link
 * MUST add an entry here AND apply the matching inline guard (see
 * applyGuard / guardReason below). `base-collections-guard-registry.test.js`
 * (a pure-fs lint in self-CI's node-unit-lints lane) goes RED if:
 *   (a) a registered spec loses its inline guard, or
 *   (b) a NEW index-local generic-collection spec appears that's neither
 *       registered here nor in the lint's explicit NON_GUARDED allowlist.
 * So the guard set can't silently drift.
