//
// #21 — judge against the SPEC'S OWN deploy, not a sliding wall-clock
// window. Pass `mergedAt` (the create PR's merged_at — epoch ms or ISO
// string) or `getMergedAt` (an async getter, used when the merge lands
// DURING the reflect wait so the timestamp isn't known up front). The
// extender then resolves the verdict in priority order:
//   1. a deploy-production run created_at>=mergedAt that COMPLETED
//      → CONCLUSIVE: the deploy fired + finished, so the chain is healthy
//        and the failure is URL-not-served (S3 sync / CloudFront). Stop
//        extending and record verdict { kind: 'deploy-completed-url-
//        missing', realMiss: false }. (The pre-#21 false negative: this
//        used to read "lane QUIESCENT" once >recentWindowMs had elapsed
//        and wrongly declared a real miss.)
//   2. a deploy for this merge still in-flight/queued (or, without a
//      mergedAt, a lane that's in-flight OR recently-active) → return a
//      proportional extension: the backlog is draining / the deploy is
//      imminent; waiting longer is correct, not flaky.
//   3. NO deploy run created_at>=mergedAt AND the lane idle → genuine
//      real miss: the chain never fired. Stop extending and record
//      verdict { kind: 'no-deploy-fired', realMiss: true }.
//   - probe error → grant ONE conservative extension rather than
//     false-failing on a transient API blip.
// The latest verdict is exposed on the returned function as
// `extender.verdict` so deploy-pill.js's timeout message can self-report
// the true failure leg. Bounded by `maxTotalExtendMs` (and by
