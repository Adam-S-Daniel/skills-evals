/*
 * UI test for Decap CMS's "unpublish" + "re-publish" flow on a real
 * `_posts/` entry. This is DISTINCT from delete: unpublishing keeps
 * the file in the repo (frontmatter `published: true` flipped to
 * `false`) and removes the public URL; re-publishing flips the flag
 * back and the URL serves again. Delete removes the file entirely.
 *
 * Why a dedicated spec rather than extending cms-publish-loop-prod-
 * mutate.spec.js: prod-mutate's purpose is "edit body + flip
 * published flag" (the mutation playground). This spec's purpose is
 * the toggle-only flow — no body edit, no marker insertion. A
 * regression in either flow should fail one spec without obscuring
 * the other.
 *
 * Fixture: `_posts/2024-01-02-e2e-unpublish-canary.md` is shipped
 * with `published: false` so the URL is hidden in the steady state.
 * The date is intentionally in the past — Jekyll's default `future:
 * false` setting skips future-dated posts during build even when
 * `published: true`, which would make the re-publish leg's URL wait
 * time out forever (the post never appears in the deploy). Use a
 * past date so `published: true/false` is the only knob that
 * controls public visibility.
 * The spec:
 *   1. Drives Decap UI to open the entry, asserts the Published
 *      toggle reads the baseline state (off).
 *   2. Asserts /blog/e2e-unpublish-canary/ 4xxs (URL hidden).
 *   3. Drives Decap UI: toggle Published → ON, Save → Status:Ready
 *      → Publish Now. Waits for the URL to flip to 200 (deploy
 *      reflected). This is the "re-publish" leg.
 *   4. Drives Decap UI: toggle Published → OFF, Save → Status:Ready
 *      → Publish Now. Waits for the URL to flip back to 4xx. This
 *      is the "unpublish" leg.
 *
 * The order intentionally is publish-first-then-unpublish (rather
 * than unpublish-first-then-republish): the baseline is OFF, so we
 * have to flip ON to assert the publish path renders, then flip OFF
 * to assert the unpublish path hides. End state matches baseline,
 * so subsequent runs start clean.
 *
 * No back doors per AGENTS.md: every state change is a Decap UI
 * click; every wait is the URL-driven helper from deploy-pill.js.
