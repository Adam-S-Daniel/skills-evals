/*
 * Helpers that seed and tear down throw-away `_e2e/` fixtures via a real
 * PR + auto-merge round-trip, instead of writing to main directly.
 *
 * Why: the `pull_request` rule on the main branch
 * (.github/rulesets/main.json) rejects every direct write to main with
 * a 409 "Repository rule violations found". The publish-loop and
 * delete-published specs used to call PUT /contents/{path} on main for
 * setup/cleanup; that path is permanently blocked. These helpers route
 * the same writes through the cms-editorial-workflow auto-merge
 * pipeline that prod already uses for content edits:
 *
 *   1. POST /git/refs    — create a branch off the current main HEAD
 *   2. PUT /contents     — commit the fixture on that branch
 *   3. POST /pulls       — open a PR with base=main
 *   4. POST /labels      — apply `cms/ready` + `decap-cms/pending_publish`
 *                          (the latter keeps Decap's "adding labels…"
 *                          label-migration dialog off /admin while open)
 *   5. cms-editorial-workflow.yml fires `auto-merge-when-ready`, which
 *      enables auto-merge; once `validate-content` + the e2e/test
 *      checks finish, the PR squash-merges itself
 *   6. waitForMerge      — block until the merge actually lands
 *
 * Branch naming is `cms/e2e-fixture/<slug>-<runId>` so the cleanup
 * workflow can recognise stale leftovers and the cms-editorial-workflow
 * `cms/draft` labeller (which keys off `cms/`) still applies.
 *
 * Used by:
 *   - e2e/cms-publish-loop.spec.js  (baseline reset + post-run cleanup)
 *   - e2e/cms-delete-published.spec.js  (throw-away fixture seed)
