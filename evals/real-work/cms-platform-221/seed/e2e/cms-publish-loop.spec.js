//
// On `cms/*` PRs (Decap-opened editorial PRs) this spec self-skips at
// runtime — RUN_HOST_REPO_PUBLISH_LOOP is unset on the standard PR
// matrix — so selecting + bringing it up just to no-op is pure waste.
// The dedicated cms-publish-loop-host workflow runs it nightly.

/*
 * Real-browser, real-HTTP, real-GitHub end-to-end test for the full Decap
 * CMS publish loop on the host repo.
 *
 * Why: cms-smoke / cms-publish-flow drive `local_backend: true` (decap-server),
 * which forces simple mode regardless of `publish_mode`. cms-editorial-workflow
 * drives the in-browser `test-repo` backend. Neither crosses the boundary into
 * the GitHub backend, the cms-editorial-workflow.yml workflow, or the
 * deploy-production.yml deploy. Issue #79 captures the failure mode that bit
 * us on PR #76→#78: Decap labels its PRs with the namespaced
 * `decap-cms/ready`, but the workflow listened for the bare `cms/ready` —
 * label mismatch, publish loop silently stalled. This spec catches it.
 *
 * Flow:
 *
 *   0. (Setup) If the canary baseline isn't already on main from the
 *      previous cleanup, open a `cms/e2e-fixture/seed-…` PR that
 *      writes it back, label it `cms/ready`, and wait for auto-merge.
 *      Direct Contents-API writes to main are blocked by the branch
 *      ruleset (`pull_request` rule), so even setup has to flow
 *      through the same auto-merge path the test exercises.
 *
 *   1. Drive the production admin URL with a pre-seeded PAT session.
 *   2. Open the e2e collection → canary entry.
 *   3. Edit body to include a unique marker; click Save.
 *   4. Decap opens a `cms/...` PR. Find it via the GitHub API.
 *   5. Wait for cms-editorial-workflow.yml validate-content to pass.
 *   6. Drive the editor's Status dropdown from Draft → Ready.
 *   7. Assert that auto-merge was enabled on the PR.
 *   8. Assert the PR merges into main.
 *   9. Assert deploy-production.yml runs on main and completes successfully.
 *  10. Assert the public adamdaniel.ai canary URL contains the marker.
 *  11. (Cleanup) Open a second `cms/e2e-fixture/cleanup-…` PR that
 *      resets the canary baseline. Same auto-merge path as step 0;
 *      we await the merge so the next run starts clean.
 *
 * Gating:
 *   - CMS_E2E_PAT must be set (host-repo only — fork PRs / Dependabot skip).
 *   - Runs once on chromium-desktop-3k. Other projects skip — exercising 8
 *     browser variants serially of a 7-minute pipeline is wasted minutes.
 *   - CI workflow only schedules this spec when CMS-affecting paths change
 *     (admin/**, _config.yml, _layouts/{post,page,project,canary}.html,
 *     scripts/patch-preview-config.sh, .github/workflows/cms-*,
 *     .github/workflows/deploy-*, e2e/cms-*, _plugins/**).

// only fires when CMS-affecting paths change. The canary probe is the
// always-on smoke check: every morning, before US/EU work hours, assert
// that the three `_e2e/canary-*` URLs are still serving their baseline
// content. If any of them 404s, drifts, or stops resolving entirely,
// the workflow opens an issue tagged `production-canary`.
//
// Read-only by construction:
//   - No Decap login (no PAT, no admin navigation, no editor drive).
//   - No PR open / label flip / merge.
//   - No Contents-API write.

//     prod baseURL set by the TARGET=prod fixture in `e2e/base.js`.
//
// The hard guard at the top of this file (assertNotProdCanary) makes the
// read-only contract machine-checked: if a future edit accidentally
// routes through writeCanaryOnMain() while PROD_CANARY=1, the spec
// throws immediately rather than silently mutating prod.
