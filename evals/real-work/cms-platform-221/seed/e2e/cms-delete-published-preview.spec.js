// @lane: real — drives the real Decap delete UI end-to-end in a PR preview env
// @select-skip-when-head-ref-prefix: cms/
//
// On `cms/*` PRs (Decap-opened editorial PRs) this spec self-skips at
// runtime — PR_NUMBER / PR_HEAD_REF / CMS_E2E_PAT aren't wired into the
// standard PR matrix — so selecting + bringing it up just to no-op is
// pure waste. The dedicated cms-delete-published-preview workflow
// exercises this path.

/*
 * Preview-side "Delete published entry" coverage. The prod sibling
 * `cms-delete-published.spec.js` proves the delete path lands on
 * `main`; this proves it on a per-PR preview environment
 * (`preview-pr<N>.adamdaniel.ai/admin/`) whose admin is patched at
 * deploy-preview time to use `backend.branch = <PR head ref>`. That's
 * a different code path (and a different branch-protection regime —
 * the `cms-feature-branches` ruleset, not main) and closes the
 * preview-side entry-deletion gap from #999's matrix.
 *
 * Both legs go through the shared `runCmsLoop` spine
 * (`e2e/run-cms-loop.js`) — the first opt-in consumer of the extracted
 * helper. No back doors: every product step (create, publish, delete)
 * is UI-driven per AGENTS.md "Never bypass the UI in a UI test." The
 * Contents-API afterAll is harness HYGIENE only (not the behaviour
 * under test) and writes ONLY to the PR head branch, so a stale
 * fixture has zero prod blast radius — it dies with the PR.
 *
 * Fixture model (mirrors the prod delete spec): the spec creates and
 * then deletes its own throw-away `_e2e/canary-delete-preview-<runId>.md`.
 * A crash mid-flow leaves a recognisable, dated stub on the PR head
 * branch (swept by the same `canary-delete-*` prefix the daily sweep
 * already recognises, and by this spec's afterAll), never a damaged
 * checked-in fixture.
 *
 *   - Seed: "+ New E2E Canary" → fill Title + Body → Save → the
 *     `cms/e2e/<slug>` PR Decap opens against the PR head branch →
 *     label `cms/ready` → cms-editorial-workflow auto-merges into the
 *     head branch → deploy-preview re-renders → the preview URL 200s
 *     with the body marker.
 *   - Delete: navigate to the just-created entry → "Delete published
 *     entry" → confirm (persistent native-dialog handler) → Decap
 *     commits the delete to the head branch (best-effort label of a
 *     delete PR if Decap opened one) → deploy-preview → the preview
 *     URL 404s.
 *
 * Gating:
 *   - CMS_E2E_PAT must be set.
 *   - PR_NUMBER must be set (the workflow exposes it from its input).
 *   - PR_HEAD_REF must be set (resolved from the PR via the API).
 *   - Runs once on chromium-desktop-3k only.

// The delete leg IS the cleanup (the UI delete removes the file from
// the PR head branch). If the test body completed, the file is gone
// and `fileShaOnBranch` returns null — harness no-ops. If the test
// failed mid-flow (chain stuck, Decap regression, etc.) the throw-away
// fixture is still on the head branch; remove it directly via the
// Contents API so the next run starts clean. Writing to the head
// branch has zero prod blast radius — the branch is deleted with the
// parent PR. Per AGENTS.md this API path is restricted to harness
// hygiene and never replaces the UI-driven delete.
