// @lane: real — drives Decap delete UI end-to-end against prod
// @select-skip-when-head-ref-prefix: cms/
//
// On `cms/*` PRs (Decap-opened editorial PRs) this spec self-skips at
// runtime — RUN_HOST_REPO_PUBLISH_LOOP is unset on the standard PR
// matrix — so selecting + bringing it up just to no-op is pure waste.
// The dedicated cms-publish-loop-host workflow runs it nightly.

/*
 * UI-driven coverage for the "Delete published entry" path. Decap's
 * delete UI uses the GitHub git data API directly (POST /git/trees →
 * POST /git/commits → PATCH /git/refs/heads/main); auto-merge engages
 * on the resulting `cms/<col>/<slug>` PR exactly like Save does, and
 * cms-editorial-workflow.yml's `auto-merge-when-ready` job lands the
 * delete once required checks pass.
 *
 * (Historical note: Decap was previously assumed to call
 * DELETE /repos/.../contents/{path}, hit the main-branch ruleset's
 * 422 "rule violations", and bounce off a shim → delete-via-pr.yml
 * recovery path. That recovery never fired because Decap's actual
 * code uses the git data API. The shim's DELETE intercept and the
 * workflow were removed once the spec confirmed the user-facing
 * contract — URL 404s — held without them.)
 *
 * Gating: identical to cms-publish-loop.spec.js's host loop —
 * RUN_HOST_REPO_PUBLISH_LOOP=1 plus a CMS_E2E_PAT must be set.
 * Runs against the same prod admin (https://adamdaniel.ai/admin/) so
 * a single dedicated workflow can drive both this and the publish
 * loop nightly.
 *
 * Fixture model: this spec creates and then deletes its own throw-
 * away `_e2e/canary-delete-<runId>.md` file. A crash mid-flow leaves
 * a recognisable, dated stub on main rather than damaging a checked-
 * in fixture. Both the seed and the delete go through the Decap UI:
 *
 *   - Seed: click "+ New E2E Canary" in the e2e collection list,
 *     fill Title + Body, Save → cms/e2e/<slug> PR opens, drive
 *     Status:Draft → Ready and Publish → Publish Now to engage
 *     auto-merge. Lands on main; deploy-production publishes the
 *     URL.
 *   - Delete: navigate to the just-created entry, click "Delete
 *     published entry", confirm via native confirm() (persistent
 *     dialog handler), wait for the URL to 404.
 *
 * No back doors — both halves are UI-driven per AGENTS.md "Never
 * bypass the UI in a UI test." On test failure, the afterAll
 * harness consults `fileExistsOnMain` and opens a parallel
 * `cms/e2e-fixture/remove-…` PR if the throw-away fixture is still
 * on main.
