// On `cms/*` PRs (Decap-opened editorial PRs) this spec self-skips at

// pure waste. The dedicated cms-publish-loop-prod workflow runs it.

/*
 * Real-browser, real-HTTP, real-GitHub end-to-end test for the full
 * Decap CMS publish loop on prod against a REAL `_posts/` entry — now an
 * EPHEMERAL, born-published, hard-deleted per-run post (#1771 step 4).
 *
 * Why ephemeral (the #1771 redesign):
 *   The loop used to mutate a single PERSISTENT committed fixture
 *   (`_posts/2099-01-01-e2e-mutation-canary.md`) in place — toggle
 *   `published`, append a body marker, then revert. A transient failure
 *   on the revert leg (a GitHub 500 on the afterAll Contents-API restore,
 *   run 26511130712) left that one shared cell corrupted on `main`; and
 *   because the next run re-derived its baseline from the same on-disk
 *   body, the corruption was self-perpetuating — wedging the loop until a
 *   human hand-edited the file. Step 4 removes the CLASS of bug: each run
 *   CREATES a uniquely-pathed post, publishes it, asserts it serves, then
 *   DELETES it. Resting state is ABSENCE (404), and absence has no corrupt
 *   variant. A killed run leaks at most ONE inert, uniquely-named orphan
 *   (`_posts/2099-12-31-e2e-prod-mutate-<runId>.md`), swept by
 *   sweep-stale-cms-prs.yml — never a shared corrupt baseline. No loop
 *   ever reads a path it also writes (the #1771 invariant).
 *
 * Fidelity: the real chain (Decap UI create → cms PR → auto-merge →
 * deploy-production → CloudFront → serve → delete → 404) is preserved
 * end-to-end and exercised MORE faithfully — it now covers a real
 * contributor's #1 action (write a new post + publish), then delete,
 * rather than re-editing one persistent file. The "re-edit an
 * already-published post" signal is kept by the persistent `_e2e/` canary
 * in cms-publish-loop.spec.js (#1771 step 5).
 *
 * Born-published + future-dated: the post ships `published: true`, date
 * `2099-12-31` (serves the same way the old `2099-01-01` canary did, via
 * `_config.yml`'s `future: true`), `robots: noindex,nofollow` +
 * `sitemap: false` (a born-published post that briefly serves never leaks
 * to search), and `test_fixture: true` (hidden from the Posts list).
 *
 * The CREATE leg publishes through Decap's editor (Status → Ready →
 * Publish → "Publish now"), exactly like the proven
 * cms-delete-published.spec.js. The merge lands via
 * cms-editorial-workflow `auto-merge-when-ready`: Status:Ready applies
 * `decap-cms/pending_publish` (engages auto-merge), and Publish Now's
 * synchronous merge attempt is 422'd by branch protection while required
 * checks are pending — admin/publish-via-auto-merge.js catches that 422
 * and adds the `cms/ready` label, re-engaging the SAME auto-merge job. The
 * PR then lands once checks pass (commit prefix `publish:` preserved). This
 * is the proven prod path; cms-delete-published.spec.js's green host-loop
 * runs land their merge exactly this way.
 *
 * The DELETE leg is the #1771 iteration-3 fix (run 26529125192). Publish
 * Now alone is NOT enough to make the UI delete remove the file from main:
 * the shim hands Decap a SYNTHETIC `merged:true` while the create PR
 * auto-merges for real only ~5–15 min later, so the `cms/posts/<slug>`
 * editorial branch lingers. If the delete leg re-opens the entry during
 * that window, Decap's loadUnpublishedEntry re-loads it as an OPEN editorial
 * draft (isNewEntry=true, hasUnpublishedChanges=true) → the editor shows
 * "Delete unpublished entry" → the click calls onDeleteUnpublishedChanges,
 * which drops only the draft branch, never main, so the URL never 404s
 * (iterations 1–3 all failed on this). The fix: the delete leg first waits
 * for the create PR to MERGE for real, then reopenForPublishedDelete()
 * poll-reloads the editor until Decap drops the (now-merged) editorial
 * entry and re-loads the published file ("Delete published entry", no
 * Status chip), and only THEN clicks delete — so the click hits onDelete
 * (delete from main → a delete PR). See e2e/cms-editor-ui.js's
 * reopenForPublishedDelete for the full analysis.
 *
 * The explicit `cms/ready` labelling of the create PR (and the delete PR)
 * is kept as belt-and-braces so auto-merge is engaged even if the shim's
 * 422→label recovery is delayed; it is idempotent with the labels Decap
 * already applies. The editor UI is fully driven (fill form, toggle
 * Published, Publish Now, Delete).
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. Create a born-published ephemeral post via the Decap "+ New Post"
 *      UI (Title + URL Slug + Date 2099-12-31 + Body + Published ON),
 *      Save → Status:Ready → Publish Now → cms/posts/<dated-slug> PR.
 *   2. Label cms/ready (belt-and-braces) → auto-merge → deploy-production.
 *   3. Assert /blog/<slug>/ serves 200 with this run's marker.
 *   4. Wait for the create PR to MERGE, re-open the entry in PUBLISHED
 *      state, Delete via the Decap "Delete published entry" UI → cms PR →
 *      cms/ready → auto-merge → deploy-production.
 *   5. Assert /blog/<slug>/ 404s.
 *   afterAll: existence-only delete (if the post is STILL on main, open a
 *   labelled removal PR via removeFixtureViaPr). No content-restore — the
 *   resting state is absence.
 *
 * Gating:
 *   - `CMS_E2E_PAT` must be set.
 *   - `RUN_PROD_MUTATE_PLAYGROUND=1` (set only in cms-publish-loop-prod.yml).
 *   - `chromium-desktop-3k` only.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: do NOT run this spec locally against prod. It mutates the
 * real production tree. The workflow runs it on a schedule/post-merge.

// restore: the forward DELETE leg IS the cleanup. If the test body
// completed, the post is gone from main and `fileExistsOnMain` returns
// false → the harness no-ops. If the test threw mid-flow, the
// uniquely-named ephemeral post may still be on main; open a labelled
// removal PR (same auto-merge path the forward leg uses) so the next run
// starts clean. A 500 here leaks ONE inert, uniquely-named orphan the
// daily sweeper reaps — never a corrupt shared baseline. Per AGENTS.md's
// harness-hygiene carve-out, this API path is harness cleanup, not the
// behaviour under test (the primary delete leg is UI-driven).
