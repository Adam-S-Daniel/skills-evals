/*
 * Lint: the CI matrix (e2e/ci-matrix.js) and the workflow that consumes it must
 * stay in lockstep, and every Playwright project must have exactly one CI job.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` runs one job per project via a STATIC
 * `matrix.project` list, because a dynamic matrix would cost an extra
 * checkout-and-node job on the critical path. Static means it can drift: add a
 * project and the list doesn't grow — and a project with no job would SILENTLY
 * STOP RUNNING. That is the one failure mode of this design a red test has to
 * catch, so it is asserted here (single source + structural lint, per AGENTS.md).
 *
 * Platform-internal: reads the platform's own reusable workflow definition and
 * playwright.config.js, so it lives in PLATFORM_META_SPECS and runs in
 * self-CI's node-unit-lints lane.
