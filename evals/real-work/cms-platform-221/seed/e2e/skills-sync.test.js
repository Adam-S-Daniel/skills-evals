// Locks the repo-local opt-out contract: the down-sync is platform-authoritative
// (rsync --delete, so a skill removed from the platform is removed from the
// site), but a site-owned skill marked with a `.repo-local` file must be
// preserved — excluded from BOTH the transfer and the --delete sweep. Without
// this, an unconditional `rsync --delete` clobbers repo-specific skills like
// adamdaniel.ai's `embeddable-tool-pages` on every sync.
