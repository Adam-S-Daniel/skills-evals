/*
 * Real-browser, real-HTTP, real-GitHub, real-production-deploy
 * end-to-end test for the FULL media lifecycle, driven entirely through
 * the Decap UI — now against an EPHEMERAL, born-published, hard-deleted
 * per-run post (#1771 step 4) instead of a persistent committed fixture:
 *
 *   1. Create a born-published ephemeral `_posts/` entry via the "+ New
 *      Post" UI, uploading a unique image via the Media UI (the Featured
 *      Image widget's media library) and attaching it.
 *   2. Save → cms PR → label cms/ready → auto-merge + deploy-production.
 *   3. Assert the post page on https://adamdaniel.ai renders the image
 *      AND that the image URL itself fetches 200 with real bytes. (This is
 *      the exact bug the flat-media-folder change fixes: a post
 *      referencing an image URL that 404s.)
 *   4. DELETE the post via the Decap UI → cms PR → cms/ready → auto-merge.
 *   5. Delete the uploaded asset via the standalone Media UI.
 *   6. Assert the post 404s and the image's live URL 404s.
 *
 * Why ephemeral (the #1771 redesign): the persistent fixture
 * (`_posts/2099-01-03-e2e-media-roundtrip.md`) shared the same
 * self-perpetuating-corruption bug as the prod-mutate twin — a transient
 * failure on the in-place revert left a corrupt shared cell on main, and
 * the next run re-derived its baseline from it. Step 4 removes the class:
 * each run creates a uniquely-pathed post + a uniquely-named image, and
 * deletes both. Resting state is ABSENCE (404). A killed run leaks at most
 * ONE inert orphan post (`_posts/2099-12-31-e2e-media-roundtrip-<runId>.md`)
 * + ONE orphan upload, both swept by sweep-stale-cms-prs.yml — never a
 * corrupt shared baseline. No loop reads a path it also writes.
 *
 * The CREATE leg publishes through Decap's editor (Status → Ready →
 * Publish → "Publish now"), exactly like the proven
 * cms-delete-published.spec.js. The merge lands via cms-editorial-workflow
 * `auto-merge-when-ready`: Status:Ready applies `decap-cms/pending_publish`
 * (engages auto-merge), and Publish Now's synchronous merge is 422'd by
 * branch protection while required checks are pending — admin/publish-via-
 * auto-merge.js catches that 422 and adds the `cms/ready` label, re-
 * engaging the SAME auto-merge job. The PR lands once checks pass. This is
 * the proven prod path (cms-delete-published.spec.js's green host-loop runs
 * land their merge exactly this way). The explicit `cms/ready` labelling of
 * the create + delete PRs is kept belt-and-braces (idempotent).
 *
 * The DELETE leg is the #1771 iteration-3 fix. Publish Now alone is NOT
 * enough to make the UI delete remove the file from main: the shim hands
 * Decap a SYNTHETIC `merged:true` while the create PR auto-merges for real
 * only ~5–15 min later, so the `cms/posts/<slug>` editorial branch lingers.
 * If the delete leg re-opens the entry during that window, Decap's
 * loadUnpublishedEntry re-loads it as an OPEN editorial draft → the editor
 * shows "Delete unpublished entry" → the click drops only the draft branch,
 * never main, so the URL never 404s (run 26529125192's exact failure: post
 * + image live, delete leg idle, NO delete PR opened). The fix: the delete
 * leg first waits for the create PR to MERGE for real, then
 * reopenForPublishedDelete() poll-reloads the editor until Decap drops the
 * (now-merged) editorial entry and re-loads the published file ("Delete
 * published entry", no Status chip), and only THEN clicks delete — so the
 * click hits onDelete (delete from main → a delete PR). See
 * e2e/cms-editor-ui.js's reopenForPublishedDelete for the full analysis.
 * The editor UI is fully driven throughout.
 *
 * Why this exists on top of the local upload specs: the local specs prove
 * the flat media_folder resolves on a local Jekyll build. This spec proves
 * it on the REAL production site through the REAL GitHub backend and the
 * REAL deploy pipeline, including the standalone Media library's delete
 * path. The Contents-API afterAll safety net is test-harness HYGIENE
 * (existence-only delete of a leftover post/upload), not the behaviour
 * under test — see AGENTS.md's harness-hygiene carve-out.
 *
 * Gating:
 *   - `CMS_E2E_PAT` must be set.
 *   - `RUN_PROD_MUTATE_PLAYGROUND=1` (same gate as the prod-mutate spec)
 *     so it only runs in cms-media-roundtrip.yml and never inside the
 *     per-PR e2e matrix or recursively on its own cms/* PR.
 *   - chromium-desktop-3k only.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: do NOT run this spec locally against prod. It mutates the
 * real production tree (a _posts/ entry + an upload). The workflow runs
 * it on a schedule.
