/*
 * Shared Decap entry-editor UI interactions.
 *
 * Why this module exists (#1723 / PR #407):
 * The Published toggle and the Save → Ready → Publish flow were copy-
 * pasted into every CMS loop spec (cms-publish-loop-prod-mutate,
 * cms-unpublish-republish, cms-media-roundtrip, and the -preview
 * variants). Copies drift: one spec's cleanup leg still looked for the
 * Published widget as `getByRole("checkbox")` while the rest had moved to
 * `getByRole("switch")` (Decap renders it as a switch). That drift sat
 * latent until #1723's future-date fix let the prod-mutate cleanup run
 * for the first time — then it failed on the stale selector. Centralising
 * these interactions here (and lint-locking that specs don't hand-roll
 * them — see cms-editor-ui.test.js) keeps every caller in sync.
 *
 * Pure helpers over the caller's Playwright `page`; `expect` comes from
 * ./base so messages match the rest of the suite.

// on the entry's editorial state:

//   hasUnpublishedChanges && isModification         → "Delete unpublished changes"

//
// History (#1771 follow-up, iterations 1–3): the ephemeral prod canaries
// originally published via the `cms/ready` label only (iter 1/2), NOT
// Decap's "Publish Now" — the external auto-merge landed the post on main
// while Decap's editor still held it as a brand-new editorial-workflow
// draft (isNewEntry=true, hasUnpublishedChanges=true). #1801 added
// publishViaUi (Status:Ready → Publish Now) to push the editor toward the
// PUBLISHED state. But the run-26529125192 failure proved publishViaUi
// alone is NOT enough: "Publish Now" hits branch protection (checks
// pending), so admin/publish-via-auto-merge.js catches the 422, labels
// `cms/ready`, and hands Decap a SYNTHETIC `merged:true`. The PR then
// auto-merges for REAL only ~5–15 min later. In the gap, the
// `cms/posts/<slug>` editorial branch still exists, so when the delete leg
// re-navigates to the entry Decap's loadUnpublishedEntry (the
// editorial-workflow loadEntry override, withWorkflow.js) re-loads it as an
// OPEN draft (currentStatus set, hasUnpublishedChanges=true). EditorToolbar
// then wires Delete to onDeleteUnpublishedChanges (line 654), which drops
// only the draft branch — never main — so no delete-from-main PR opens and
// the URL never 404s. The iteration-3 fix (this follow-up) is
// reopenForPublishedDelete() below: the specs first wait for the create PR
// to MERGE for real, then poll-reload the editor until Decap drops the
// editorial entry and re-loads the published file ("Delete published
// entry", no Status chip), and only THEN click delete — so the click hits
// onDelete (delete from main).
//
// Match ALL five label variants anyway so the click is robust regardless of
// which editorial state Decap shows. The control is a real <button> (the styled
// `ToolbarButton` is `styled("button")` in the bundle), so getByRole
// finds it. Pin a timeout so a future UI shape change fails fast with a

// entry"). A Delete click there calls `onDeleteUnpublishedChanges` and
// removes only the draft branch; the file on main is untouched, no
