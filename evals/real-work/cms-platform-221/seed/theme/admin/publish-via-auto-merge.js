/*
 * publish-via-auto-merge.js — admin/ shim that recovers the Decap
 * "Publish Now" button when it hits GitHub's branch-protection ruleset:
 *
 *   "Publish Now" on a Ready cms/ PR  → PUT /pulls/{N}/merge
 *     Decap calls the synchronous merge API. The main-branch ruleset
 *     requires every PR to pass 6 status checks (~10 min runtime),
 *     so the call returns 422 "Repository rule violations found".
 *     We recover by adding the `cms/ready` label, which makes
 *     cms-editorial-workflow.yml's `auto-merge-when-ready` job enable
 *     auto-merge — the PR then merges itself when the checks land.
 *
 * The merge matcher kicks in on a 422 "rule violations" (the ruleset
 * blocked a synchronous merge) OR a 405/409 "not mergeable yet" (checks
 * not recomputed after the base moved); the delete-ref matcher kicks in
 * on a 422 "rule violations" only. Any other response passes through
 * untouched, and a successful 2xx is a no-op.
 *
 * We hand Decap back a synthetic 422 (deliberately NOT a 2xx). A 2xx
 * would make Decap's github backend treat the merge as done and then
 * run an UNCONDITIONAL deleteBranch(headBranch) — publishUnpublishedEntry
 * is `await mergePR(pr); await deleteBranch(branch)` and the merge body's
 * `merged` flag is discarded — which deletes the editorial head ref and
 * auto-CLOSES the still-open, unmerged PR before auto-merge lands it
 * (#80 layer 9; PR #2295). The 422 makes Decap's mergePR re-throw (it
 * routes ONLY 405 to forceMergePR, never 422), so deleteBranch is never
 * reached and the PR survives, armed with cms/ready, to merge+deploy for
 * real when the checks pass. A toast warns the operator the change goes
 * live in 5–15 min; Decap also flashes its own publish error, which the
 * toast pre-empts.
 *
 * Loaded via a non-deferred <script> tag in admin/index.html *before*
 * decap-cms.js, so the wrap is in place before Decap captures any
 * reference to window.fetch.
 *
 * "Delete published entry" on a published post → PATCH
 *     /git/refs/heads/<default-branch>. Decap's delete UI does NOT use
 *     DELETE /contents; it uses the git data API directly
 *     (GET /branches/<b> → POST /git/trees with sha:null → POST
 *     /git/commits → PATCH /git/refs/heads/<b>). Steps 1-3 succeed
 *     (dangling tree/commit objects are not ruleset-gated); the final
 *     PATCH that moves the branch ref returns 422 "Repository rule
 *     violations found" because direct writes to the protected branch
 *     are blocked. main is never updated, no PR is opened, no deploy
 *     fires. We recover by reading the deletion commit sha straight
 *     out of the PATCH request body, creating a `cms/` branch ref at
 *     that commit, opening a PR (base=<default-branch>), and adding
 *     the `cms/ready` label so the SAME auto-merge-when-ready job
 *     lands the delete PR (whose diff removes the file) once the
 *     required checks pass. Decap gets a synthetic merged:true.
 *     The PR is also labelled `decap-cms/pending_publish` at creation:
 *     an open `cms/*` PR with NO `decap-cms/*` label makes Decap run
 *     its label migration on every /admin load — the persistent
 *     "adding labels to N of your Editorial Workflow entries" dialog —
 *     and for these PRs the migration never completes (no legacy
 *     metadata to migrate), so the dialog never clears on its own.
 *
 * Note: a previous version of this shim instead intercepted DELETE
 * /contents and dispatched a `delete-via-pr.yml` workflow. That
 * intercept never fired in production — for the reason above (git
 * data API, not DELETE /contents) — and the workflow had zero runs;
 * it was removed and replaced by the PATCH /git/refs delete-ref
 * recovery matcher below.
