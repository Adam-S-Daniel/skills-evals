# _agent-guidance

The **guidance layer** of Adam Daniel's agent setup: shared `AGENTS.md` content
and the sync machinery that propagates it into every repo in the account, with a
nightly drift dashboard.

This repo deliberately does **not** carry skills. Reusable skills live in the
canonical registry, [Adam-S-Daniel/adam-agentskills](https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/adam-agentskills)
(private/sensitive ones in `adam-agentskills-private`) — consume them from there via
the plugin marketplace or that repo's `setup.sh`. The two-layer split (skills vs
guidance) is documented in the registry's
[`STRATEGY.md`](https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/adam-agentskills/blob/main/STRATEGY.md).
The skills that used to live here (`debug-github-workflows`,
`review-bash-ci-reliability`) were promoted into the registry.

## How it works

- `agents-md/base.md` + `agents-md/sections/<name>.md` — the managed guidance
  content, composed per-repo by `scripts/build-agents-md.sh`.
- Consumer repos opt into sections by dropping a `.agents-sync.yml` in their root
  (see `.agents-sync.example.yml`).
- `scripts/sync.sh` (CI: `sync.yml`) scans the account's repos, rebuilds each
  repo's managed `AGENTS.md` portion, preserves anything under
  `## Repo-specific additions`, and pushes the change directly to the
  default branch when content changed. This works because the
  `agents-md-sync` GitHub App holds a declared ruleset bypass on every
  fleet-managed repo — declared as code in
  [Adam-S-Daniel/repo-settings](https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/repo-settings)
  (see that repo's ADR 0001). Repos whose branch protection still rejects
  the direct push (the cms-platform-managed sites) fall back to opening a
  PR (`agents-md-sync/update`) and enabling auto-merge on it, left open
  for manual merge only if auto-merge can't be enabled. It also creates
  the `CLAUDE.md` bridge in repos that lack one, warns (in the sync log,
  and in the fallback PR's body) when an existing `CLAUDE.md` doesn't
  import `@AGENTS.md`, and can rewrite such a file when the repo opts in
  via `fix_claude_md: true` — see [The CLAUDE.md bridge](#the-claudemd-bridge).
- `scripts/drift-report.sh` (CI: nightly `drift-report.yml`) writes
  `drift-report.md`, a dashboard of which repos are missing or out of date,
  including a "CLAUDE.md bridge" column (`bridge-ok` / `no-import` /
  `missing`). This tracks **AGENTS.md drift** — it is the guidance layer
  working as designed, not the skill-copy drift that the strategy
  consolidation removed. Per repo-settings' ADR 0001, this generated data
  never lands on the protected default branch — the old standing-PR model
  is gone — so the report is force-pushed nightly to its own unprotected
  results branch, the same pattern skills-evals uses for `eval-results`:
  [`drift-report-latest`](https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/_agent-guidance/blob/drift-report-latest/drift-report.md).
- `scripts/sync.sh` / `scripts/drift-report.sh` consult the central
  `repos.yml` registry for repos excluded from sync entirely, for
  `default_sections` applied to repos with no `.agents-sync.yml` of their own,
  and for the `skills_bootstrap` allowlist + pin (see
  [The skills-bootstrap hook](#the-skills-bootstrap-hook)).
- **This repo's own `AGENTS.md` is a committed artifact**, not a synced one:
  `sync.sh` excludes its own repo (`SYNC_SELF_REPO`), which left the repo where
  the guidance is written as the one repo whose agents never read it. It is
  rebuilt from `agents-md/` and diffed by CI ("Self-guidance is current"), so a
  `base.md` edit that forgets to regenerate it fails the build — and a PR that
  changes `base.md` shows the exact text the fleet is about to receive, in the
  same diff. Regeneration command: see `AGENTS.md`'s own "Repo-specific
  additions" section. Reasoning:
  [`docs/decisions/0002`](docs/decisions/0002-unconditional-rules-live-in-the-guidance-not-a-skill.md).

### Codex

Claude Code reads a repo's `AGENTS.md` whole; **Codex does not**. It walks the
`AGENTS.md` chain from the project root down to cwd under a running byte
budget, `project_doc_max_bytes`, **default 32768**, and a file that does not
fit is *cut at that byte* — not skipped, not reported. The only trace is a
`tracing::warn!` in `codex-rs/core/src/agents_md.rs` that no ordinary session
surfaces. Measured 2026-09-14 (codex-cli 0.154.0): `codex debug prompt-input`,
which renders the model-visible instructions without a model call, showed
exactly 32,768 bytes of a 55,788-byte checkout of cms-platform's AGENTS.md
(the copy on `main` was 71,794 bytes), ending mid-heading.

Three gates make that visible, and none of them blocks a repo — the managed
half is under budget by construction, so an overrun is always in the repo's own
`## Repo-specific additions`:

- `scripts/check-agents-md.sh` invariant **7**: a file over 32768 bytes fails,
  naming the byte count and the remedy.
- `scripts/sync.sh` emits a `::warning::` naming the repo and its size, and
  **syncs it anyway** — withholding the managed guidance over content the sync
  does not own would be the wrong half to punish.
- `scripts/drift-report.sh` adds a `codex-truncated: <bytes> > 32768` clause to
  that repo's **Notes**, explained in the report's own legend.

The managed half is held clear of the budget by size tests in
`test/run-tests.sh`: `agents-md/base.md` ≤ 24 KiB and a full-mode build with
every section ≤ 28 KiB, so even a full-mode repo keeps ≥ 4 KiB for its own
additions (a stub-mode repo — all 19 today — keeps nearly all of it).

The guidance itself reaches Codex a different way. The `fleet-memory`
SessionStart hook (`.claude/hooks/fleet-memory.sh`) writes its marked block to
**two** destinations: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, Claude Code's user memory, and
`~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, Codex's global **user** instructions — which are loaded
by `codex-rs/codex-home/src/instructions/mod.rs` and are *not* counted against
the project-doc budget. The Codex write happens only when `~/.codex` already
exists; the hook never creates it, so a machine without Codex gets nothing new.
One verdict line covers both, and `FLEET_GUIDANCE_SKIP` opts out of both.

Codex runs that hook through a **user-level** `SessionStart` entry, registered
once per machine with `scripts/register-codex-hook.sh` (default target
`~/.codex/hooks.json`) and then **trusted once** in the Codex TUI with
`/hooks` — Codex trusts non-managed hooks per definition hash per config layer,
so a per-repo `.codex/hooks.json` would cost one review prompt in every repo.
Reasoning: [`docs/decisions/0012`](docs/decisions/0012-codex-gets-the-guidance-as-user-instructions.md).

The Codex Cloud cold-start path is verified with **Manual** environment setup
and persistent `CODEX_HOME=/opt/codex`: preserve `npm ci`, then run
`bash .claude/hooks/fleet-memory.sh --codex-cloud` in both setup and
maintenance, and reset the cache for the first verification. Setup and
maintenance are both verified in live Cloud sessions. Configuration and proof:
[`docs/codex-cloud.md`](docs/codex-cloud.md).

### Memory notes outside a repo

Claude Code's auto-memory writes one markdown file per fact under
`${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/projects/<encoded-cwd>/memory/`, one directory
per cwd a session has ever run in — **22** on this machine, none of them inside
any repo. A fact recorded there is a fact one agent on one machine can see.

**The contract:** every note whose `metadata.type` is not `user` carries
`metadata.home`, either `<owner>/<repo>:<path>` or
`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<ref>/<path>`, naming the *committed*
file that holds the durable copy — an ADR, a `docs/` page, that repo's
`## Repo-specific additions`, or a skill in the registry. With a home the note
is a **pointer**; the repo copy is the source of truth. A `type: user` note is
exempt: it is about the person, not the work. A home is **dangling** when a
local clone of `<repo>` is found but `<path>` is not in it.

- `.claude/hooks/memory-home.sh` runs on two events. On **SessionStart** it
  marks the session and names any homeless or dangling note (up to five, then
  `+K more`) — and prints **nothing** when every note has a home. On **Stop**
  it blocks with `{"decision":"block","reason":"…"}` when *this* session (notes
  newer than its marker) wrote one without a home, once: `stop_hook_active`
  turns the second pass into a `systemMessage` instead. It never edits or
  deletes a note and always exits 0. `memory-home: DEGRADED — <reason>` is
  reserved for **run-level** faults — no python3, no PyYAML, an unreadable hook
  event, an unwritable marker directory — and gates nothing. A note it cannot
  *parse* is a finding about that note, not a verdict about the run: the scan
  continues and the note is flagged with its reason,
  `<path> (unparseable frontmatter — quote the description or fix the YAML)`.
  That case is the common one, not the exotic one — Claude Code writes
  `description:` values unquoted, so any description containing `: ` is YAML
  PyYAML rejects, and four such notes existed here the day the hook was
  written.
- `scripts/register-memory-home-hook.sh` wires both groups into
  `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/settings.json` — **user level**, because
  memory is per machine, not per repo. Same posture as the two registrars
  above: append never overwrite, exit 3 on an unparseable file with no write,
  idempotent, and it never creates the config directory. `--hook <abs path>`
  overrides the wired path, which is how a run from a worktree points at the
  main checkout.

Promotion is deliberately **not** automatic — choosing which repo owns a fact,
and which file inside it, is judgment. Reasoning:
[`docs/decisions/0013`](docs/decisions/0013-a-memory-note-outside-a-repo-names-its-home.md).

### Section manifest

[`agents-md/eval-coverage.yml`](agents-md/eval-coverage.yml) is one row per
`##` heading in `agents-md/base.md` and per file under `agents-md/sections/`
(each of those is a single `##`). A heading has no identity but its own
wording, and wording changes — so each row carries a stable `id` alongside
the current `heading` text, and `id` never moves when a heading gets
reworded. Every row is `gap` (tracked, no eval yet), `covered` (names a
[skills-evals](https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/skills-evals) fixture path),
or `skipped` (names a `reason` and a `since` date).
[`scripts/check-guidance-coverage.js`](scripts/check-guidance-coverage.js)
(CI: the "Section manifest covers every guidance heading" step in
[`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) is the graduation gate: it parses the
real markdown with `markdown-it` (never a line scan — a fenced code block can
contain a `## ` that is not a heading, and a line scanner cannot tell the
difference) and fails when a heading has no row, a row's heading no longer
exists anywhere (a stale row, reported with the nearest current heading as
the likely rename target), two rows share an `id`, two headings share the
same text, a `covered` row's fixture is missing, a `skipped` row has no
`reason` or no `since` date, or a row's generated `bytes` — the section's
byte extent, regenerated with `--write-bytes` — has drifted from the real
file. A section added with no row is red, naming the heading and the two ways
to close it.

### Touch gate

[`docs/guidance-impact.md`](docs/guidance-impact.md) is the audit trail for
every change to a `##` section's own content — creations, edits, renames,
removals, and rejected proposals — modeled on adam-agentskills'
[`docs/skill-impact.md`](https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/adam-agentskills/blob/main/docs/skill-impact.md).
[`scripts/check-guidance-touch.js`](scripts/check-guidance-touch.js) (CI: the
"Guidance touch gate" step in [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml),
`pull_request` runs only) enforces it: for every manifest `id` whose section
body differs between the merge-base of a PR's base and head shas and the
PR's head itself, this diff's addition to
`docs/guidance-impact.md` must carry an entry for that id whose `Eval:` line
is a real result, `exempt (skipped row)` (legal only while the row is
`skipped`), or `none — no fixture yet` (legal only while the row is `gap`). A
pure rename needs no entry; a removed section
needs one typed `remove`. On a branch that forked before
`agents-md/eval-coverage.yml` existed, the gate falls back to the base branch
tip's manifest and resolves each of its rows by **exact** heading text at the
PR's own commits, so a body edit under an unchanged heading is still caught.
It never approximates: a row the exact match cannot resolve is exit 2 naming
that row and the remedy — merge or rebase onto the base branch, after which
the manifest exists at both shas and no fallback runs at all.

## The skills-bootstrap hook

The sync can also deliver `.claude/hooks/skills-bootstrap.sh` — a
`SessionStart` hook from the
[adam-agentskills](https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/adam-agentskills) registry that
installs a repo's declared skill bundles into **ephemeral** Claude surfaces
(cloud sessions, CI runners). It no-ops on a developer's machine, where the
marketplace install stays authoritative. This closes the gap where cloud
sessions get no plugins from repo-declared settings, without every repo
vendoring a mirror of the registry.

**It is opt-in, and the default reach is a deliberate decision, not whatever
repo discovery happens to do.** Delivery requires *two independent keys*:

1. the repo is listed in `repos.yml`'s `skills_bootstrap.repos` — the fleet
   operator's allowlist; **and**
2. the repo already carries its own `skills.lock` — the repo owner's
   declaration of which bundles it installs, at which pins.

Allowlisting a repo that has no lock is a no-op with a log line, not a
half-install: the hook *without* a lock is not inert — it prints a permanent
`skills: DEGRADED — no skills.lock found` verdict into every ephemeral session
of that repo, naming a generator script no consumer has.

**The sync never writes `skills.lock` — not even to create one.** Locks are
per-repo and some federate several registries (adamdaniel.ai's carries both
`adam-agentskills` and `cms-platform`), so a fleet-wide writer would eventually
flatten someone's declaration. There is deliberately no code path for it, and
`sync.sh` refuses to commit if that file is ever staged.

Mechanics:

- The hook is **fetched, not vendored**: `repos.yml` pins the registry, an
  immutable commit, and the file's sha256; the sync verifies the digest before
  writing. Fanning a hook fix across the fleet is a one-line pin bump. A digest
  mismatch disables delivery for the run and fails it — `AGENTS.md` still syncs.
- `.claude/settings.json` is **appended to, never overwritten**, as a separate
  `hooks.SessionStart` group, so an existing `scripts/setup-hooks.sh` entry
  keeps its own matcher, timeout and position. An unparseable file is refused
  rather than rewritten. Registration is idempotent
  (`scripts/register-bootstrap-hook.sh`), and `scripts/bootstrap-status.sh` is
  the shared classifier — `registered` / `no-entry` / `unparseable` /
  `missing` — used by both the sync and the drift report.
- A hook that **drifts** from the pin is overwritten (it is machinery with no
  repo-specific seam; the escape hatch is the allowlist, not a `fix_*` flag).
- A repo that gitignores `.claude/` is **warned and skipped, never
  `git add -f`'d** — `git add` on an ignored path exits 1, which under
  `set -euo pipefail` would abort the whole fleet run.
- The drift report gains a `skills-bootstrap` column (`ok` / `no-entry` /
  `drifted` / `missing` / `no-lock` / `unmanaged`) and prints each lock's pins
  in Notes — the only thing in the fleet that surfaces a stale lock, since a
  stale one installs cleanly and reports `OK` in-session.
- The drift report also reads the registry in **both directions**, since it is
  the only thing here that discovers what the account actually holds: a repo it
  found that neither `skills_bootstrap` key classifies, and a name those keys
  claim that no owner returned. Each is a section of the report plus its own
  sidecar — `drift-report-skills-unclassified.txt` and
  `drift-report-skills-orphans.txt` — which `drift-report.yml` turns into a
  `ci`-labelled issue, because a 06:00 cron notifies nobody. The second never
  concludes "deleted" (a private repo answers 404 exactly like a removed one)
  and is **withheld** rather than written empty on a run where any owner's
  listing failed, so a partial enumeration can neither raise it nor close it.

Full reasoning, including the repos deliberately left off the allowlist and
what this leaves unsolved:
[`docs/decisions/0001-skills-bootstrap-delivery-is-opt-in.md`](docs/decisions/0001-skills-bootstrap-delivery-is-opt-in.md),
then [`0004`](docs/decisions/0004-skills-bootstrap-adopted-where-sessions-happen.md)
for the widening to ten repos and why this one self-hosts instead of being
allowlisted.

## The CLAUDE.md bridge

### Why

Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`, not `AGENTS.md` — there is no native
`AGENTS.md` support (tracked upstream: anthropics/claude-code#6235, open,
no commitment). So the sync creates a two-line bridge file in every repo it
touches:

```
<!-- Managed by _agent-guidance: bridges Claude Code (which reads CLAUDE.md) to AGENTS.md. -->
@AGENTS.md
```

An existing `CLAUDE.md` is never rewritten without the repo opting in via
`fix_claude_md: true` (see `.agents-sync.example.yml`).

This isn't hypothetical: a `CLAUDE.md` in `adamdaniel.ai` that merely
*linked* to `AGENTS.md` (`See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for the agent
guidance.`) instead of importing it left roughly 1,300 lines of managed
guidance completely unread by Claude Code for months
(Adam-S-Daniel/adamdaniel.ai#2545). Nothing failed loudly — the file existed,
it just wasn't a working bridge. That's why bridge status is now surfaced in
the drift report, the sync log, and the fallback PR's body when one exists,
not just checked silently.

### Bridge contract

- `@AGENTS.md` must start its own line, outside code spans and fenced code
  blocks — a fenced example of the syntax is documentation, not a working
  import. (`scripts/bridge-status.sh` enforces exactly this rule.)
- Only in-repo relative imports are reliable: importing an absolute path
  outside the repo triggers an interactive approval dialog, which is
  silently dropped in headless/CI runs.
- Import chains resolve at most 4 hops deep; the bridge here uses exactly 1.
- Imported files must keep the `.md` extension (anthropics/claude-code#18518).
- The HTML-comment header in the bridge file is stripped before injection —
  it's human-only signage and costs no context budget.

### Why not a symlink (decision record)

A `CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md` symlink looks simpler than a bridge file. It was
considered and rejected, so this isn't relitigated every time it comes up:

- On Windows without Developer Mode + `core.symlinks=true`, git checks out
  the symlink as a plain text file containing the literal string
  `AGENTS.md` — which is *exactly* the broken no-import state this whole
  mechanism exists to catch, and it happens silently.
- Open upstream bug anthropics/claude-code#66559: Edit/Write refuse to write
  through a symlinked `CLAUDE.md`, breaking `/init` and any agent-driven
  memory edit.
- GitHub's UI and API treat a symlink as indirection, not content — anything
  reading `CLAUDE.md` over the API (including this repo's own drift report)
  would need to resolve it specially.
- The upstream changelog has a track record of `.claude/`-path symlink bugs.
- And no upside: every context where the import fails is a context where
  `CLAUDE.md` isn't read at all, so a symlink buys nothing a plain file
  doesn't already provide.

### Verification

Static checks (`bridge-status.sh`, the drift report) prove the bridge has
the right *shape*. Only an end-to-end probe proves it actually *loads*. The
behavioral canary for that lives in a separate repo: a magic-token eval in
[Adam-S-Daniel/skills-evals](https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/skills-evals)
(`evals/guidance-bridge-canary`, skills-evals#5).

Loader behavior isn't stable enough to check once and forget: it changed at
least three times in about a year upstream — the SDK's `settingSources`
default flip (and revert), subagent memory-passing changes, and the
`--add-dir` flag. Run the canary again on Claude Code CLI major version
bumps.

### Watch upstream

anthropics/claude-code#6235 tracks native `AGENTS.md` support. It's open
with no commitment either way. If it ships, the bridge becomes redundant but
harmless — nothing breaks by leaving it in place. The canary eval's
`no-bridge` layout turning visible is the signal to simplify the fleet if
that day comes.

## Required secrets

The sync workflow scans repos across **two GitHub accounts** —
`Adam-S-Daniel` and the `jodidaniel` org (see `SYNC_OWNERS` in `sync.yml`) —
so whatever token(s) back the sync need `contents:write` and
`pull-requests:write` on **all target repos in both accounts**. `sync.sh` and
`drift-report.sh` resolve a **per-owner token** at the top of each owner's
loop iteration: for owner `$ORG` they look for `GH_TOKEN_<OWNER>`, where
`<OWNER>` is `$ORG` uppercased with `-` and `.` mapped to `_` (e.g.
`Adam-S-Daniel` → `GH_TOKEN_ADAM_S_DANIEL`, `jodidaniel` →
`GH_TOKEN_JODIDANIEL`). If that's set it's used for the whole iteration; if
not, they fall back to the plain `GH_TOKEN` captured before the loop started
(restored on every iteration, so one owner's per-owner token never leaks into
another's). The workflows populate `GH_TOKEN_<OWNER>` by minting a short-lived
token per owner from a GitHub App at runtime — **mode (a) below, now active**.
Modes (b) and (c) remain documented alternatives; using them means swapping the
`create-github-app-token` mint steps back for `secrets.*` env references.

### a) GitHub App (active — no rotation, ever)

The workflows run in this mode. One GitHub App (`agents-md-sync`) with
permissions `Contents: read & write`, `Pull requests: read & write`, and
`Metadata: read`, installed on **both** the `Adam-S-Daniel` account and the
`jodidaniel` org with access to every target repo. Its App ID is stored as the
repository **variable** `APP_CLIENT_ID` (the App's Client ID -- not its
numeric App ID; the action's `app-id` input is deprecated) and its private
key as the repository **secret** `APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.

`sync.yml` and `drift-report.yml` each mint a short-lived installation token
**per owner** at runtime with
[`actions/create-github-app-token`](https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token)
(pinned to a full commit SHA) — one step per owner, writing into
`GH_TOKEN_ADAM_S_DANIEL` / `GH_TOKEN_JODIDANIEL`. Each token lives ~1 hour, is
scoped to that owner's repos, and is minted fresh every run, so nothing expires
and there is no PAT to rotate. The mint steps are `continue-on-error`, so a
missing installation on one owner only skips that owner's repos; sync hard-fails
only if **neither** token can be minted.

### b) Alternative: two fine-grained PATs (single-owner scope each)

A fine-grained PAT is scoped to a single GitHub resource owner, which maps
cleanly onto the per-owner token resolution above. Create one fine-grained
PAT per account with `contents:write` + `pull-requests:write` on all target
repos, and add them as repository secrets:

- `AGENTS_SYNC_READWRITE_TOKEN_ADAM_S_DANIEL`
- `AGENTS_SYNC_READWRITE_TOKEN_JODIDANIEL`

Optionally add a read-only pair for the nightly drift report (`contents:read`
+ `pull-requests:read`):

- `AGENTS_SYNC_READONLY_TOKEN_ADAM_S_DANIEL`
- `AGENTS_SYNC_READONLY_TOKEN_JODIDANIEL`

GitHub has no API to create or regenerate a PAT, so regeneration on expiry is
manual by design — GitHub emails the token owner before it expires. After
regenerating, update the secret with:

```
gh secret set <NAME> --repo Adam-S-Daniel/_agent-guidance
```

### c) Alternative: one classic PAT with `repo` scope (shared, coarser-grained)

Classic PATs aren't resource-owner-scoped, so a single token can cover repos
across both accounts (as long as the token's owner has access to both). Add
it as `AGENTS_SYNC_READWRITE_TOKEN` (and, for the drift report,
`AGENTS_SYNC_READONLY_TOKEN` with read-only scopes). This is the shared
fallback used by any owner that has no per-owner token of its own — the two
modes can be mixed, e.g. a per-owner PAT for one account and the shared
classic PAT covering the other.

Add the App credentials (or the alternative PAT secrets) under Settings →
Secrets and variables → Actions on this repo — `APP_CLIENT_ID` as a **variable**,
`APP_PRIVATE_KEY` as a **secret**. In App mode, `sync.yml`'s "Verify at least
one installation token was minted" step emits a `::warning::` for any owner
whose token could not be minted (App not installed there) and continues,
skipping that owner's repos; it hard-fails the whole job only if **neither**
owner's token could be minted, since `gh` would otherwise fail opaquely (exit
code 4) partway through the run.

The nightly drift report only reads repo contents, so it mints the same
per-owner App tokens but keeps the default `github.token` as a base fallback
(covering whichever account owns this repo). If an owner's App token can't be
minted, its private repos simply show up as fetch failures in the report — a
workable degraded mode rather than a hard failure.

## Dependabot config health

A daily sweep (`scripts/dependabot-config-health.js`) over every non-fork,
non-archived repo under both `SYNC_OWNERS`, filing ONE `ci`-labelled tracking
issue IN the affected repo when its `.github/dependabot.yml` is invalid
(GitHub's own `dependabot` check run on that config concluded failure) or
silent (no Dependabot update job has run within its own schedule's
threshold). See
[ADR 0014](docs/decisions/0014-dependabot-config-health-is-swept-centrally.md)
for the 36-day incident that motivated it, the measured facts the design
rests on, and the rejected alternatives.

Credential: the existing `agents-md-sync` GitHub App, widened on 2026-09-15
with Actions: Read, Checks: Read and Issues: Read & write (it already carried
Contents: write, Pull requests: write and Metadata: read for the AGENTS.md
sync) — no new App and no new private key.
`.github/workflows/dependabot-config-health.yml` mints the same per-owner
tokens `sync.yml`/`drift-report.yml` already do, from the same repository
**variable** `APP_CLIENT_ID` and repository **secret** `APP_PRIVATE_KEY`
(see "Required secrets" above), down-scoped at mint time via
`actions/create-github-app-token`'s `permission-*` inputs to exactly what the
sweep needs.

Local dry run:

```bash
SYNC_OWNERS="Adam-S-Daniel jodidaniel" node scripts/dependabot-config-health.js --dry-run
```

## Cron coverage

A `schedule:`-triggered workflow fails silently — no PR goes red, nothing
notifies. This repo's own `drift-report.yml` was red for 26 consecutive nights
before anyone noticed. `scripts/check-cron-coverage.js` is the gate that says a
repo running crons actually calls cms-platform's `scheduled-run-health`
reusable, and that the caller it has can fire and can file.

Two forms, answering two different questions:

```bash
# "Is THIS repo covered?" — what ci.yml runs. A runner has exactly one repo
# checked out, so this is the form that can exist in CI at all.
node scripts/check-cron-coverage.js

# "Is the FLEET covered?" — every repo repos.yml names under
# cron_coverage.fleet, resolved against a disk root. A named repo that is not
# there, or is not fully checked out, is an ERROR: absence is never a pass.
node scripts/check-cron-coverage.js --repos-root /home/user

# …or an explicit subset, on purpose.

```

The gate is offline by design (pure filesystem, no network), so it can only
know the fleet `repos.yml` declares. `drift-report.sh` is the half that
discovers, and it flags any repo in either owner that neither
`cron_coverage.fleet` nor `cron_coverage.out_of_scope` classifies — so the list
can go stale, but not quietly. See
[ADR 0003](docs/decisions/0003-cron-coverage-is-fleet-listed.md) for why the
fleet is declared rather than inferred from whatever happens to be cloned.

## The weekly centralization audit

Every workflow in this repo answers a mechanical question — does the managed
block match a fresh build, is the hook pin current, is each `skills.lock`
re-pinned. None of them answers the one that decides whether centralization is
actually working: **is this paragraph, sitting under one repo's
`## Repo-specific additions`, fleet-general?** That is a judgement about
meaning, and it is made against ~1,500 lines of repo-specific prose spread over
eighteen repos.

So it runs weekly as a **Claude Routine** in Adam's account rather than as a
workflow here. The Routine's prompt is deliberately thin and points at the
spec, which lives in this repo so it can be reviewed and corrected by pull
request:

- [`docs/routines/guidance-centralization.md`](docs/routines/guidance-centralization.md)
  — the spec: the procedure, the measured traps, the dated baseline.
- [`docs/routines/guidance-centralization.routine.md`](docs/routines/guidance-centralization.routine.md)
  — the Routine's own configuration, captured from the claude.ai Routines
  API by [`scripts/capture-routine.py`](scripts/capture-routine.py) so that an
  edit made on claude.ai arrives here as a diff rather than as a difference
  against nothing. Configuration only: runtime state is deliberately excluded
  and identifiers are redacted, both for reasons the script's header gives.

It audits three things — that nothing multi-repo-applicable is stranded in one
repo (and that centralized content is not still duplicated locally), that every
repo receives `base.md` or has a written exclusion, and that section opt-ins
fit the repo. If it changes anything, it drives propagation and verifies the
change reached each consumer.

Two things it is explicitly told **not** to do, because both are tempting and
both are wrong: trust the nightly drift report without re-checking against the
repos (its `Has marker` column is wrong for `AGENTS.md` files over ~48 KB, and
that error cascades into a false `drift-detected`), and mass-apply the
`agents-md/sections/` files to every repo that happens to contain a matching
file extension.
