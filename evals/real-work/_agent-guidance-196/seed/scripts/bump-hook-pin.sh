# bump-hook-pin.sh — re-pin repos.yml's `skills_bootstrap.ref`/`sha256` onto
# the registry's current skills-bootstrap hook, as one pull request on THIS
# repo.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Two pins decide what an ephemeral session actually gets, and
# until this script they moved on completely different cadences:
#
#   * each consumer's `skills.lock` — WHICH bundles at WHICH commit. Re-pinned
#     nightly by bump-consumer-locks.sh, so a skill added to the registry
#     reaches the fleet within a day, with no human in the loop.
#   * repos.yml's `skills_bootstrap.ref`/`sha256` — the HOOK that reads that
#     lock. Moved only when somebody hand-edited this file, which had happened
#     five times in the six days after delivery shipped and not once since.
#
# The gap that produced this script, measured 2026-08-25: agentskills #131
# ("install the union of every discovered lock in a multi-repo session") merged
# as da48d29 and the nightly bumper re-pinned adamdaniel.ai's lock onto that
# very commit the same night — while its hook stayed at f92569e, the pin from
# 2026-08-19. So the fleet was running #131's LOCK against a pre-#131 HOOK, and
# nothing anywhere was going to notice: the pin was internally consistent (the
# delivered bytes matched the recorded digest exactly), the sync was not
# lagging, and there was no queued work. There was simply nothing that ever
# proposed a new value. That is the shape of failure this closes.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO — auto-merge. bump-consumer-locks.sh sweeps
# its own previous night's PRs because a lock bump's blast radius is one repo's
# skills, reverted by one revert. Merging THIS pull request is what makes
# sync.yml fan a new hook into all ten allowlisted repos on its next run
# (`repos.yml` is in that workflow's `paths:` filter precisely so it does), and
# a hook is code that runs at the start of every ephemeral session in every one
# of them. That is a human's call, so this script opens the PR and stops. See
# docs/decisions/0010.
#
# ANTI-CHURN, and why it is keyed on the DIGEST rather than the commit. A
# re-pinner keyed on "is `ref` the registry's newest commit" would open a pull
# request here every single night, because the registry moves for reasons that
# have nothing to do with the hook — a skill edit, a doc, an ADR. A fleet that
# learns to ignore these PRs is worse than no re-pinner (Test 8's own
# `repo-current` fixture exists for the same reason one lane over). So the
# question asked here is "did the hook's BYTES change", and a run where they
# did not writes nothing at all. A consequence worth stating because it looks
# like a bug: `ref` therefore lags the registry's HEAD by design, and names the
# commit at which the hook last CHANGED. That is the more useful pin anyway —
# it is the commit a reviewer wants when asking "what is this hook".

#   BUMP_REGISTRY      — OWNER/REPO of the registry that owns the hook
#                        (default: repos.yml skills_bootstrap.registry)
#   BUMP_CHECKOUTS     — where each registry is checked out on THIS machine, as
#                        space- or newline-separated OWNER/REPO=PATH entries.
#                        The same variable bump-consumer-locks.sh consumes, and
#                        required for the same reason: a guessed path is how
#                        sync-skills once enumerated nothing (see AGENTS.md), so
#                        nothing here encodes a repo location as a constant.
#   HOOK_PIN_REPO      — OWNER/REPO carrying repos.yml, i.e. the repo this

#                        (default: GITHUB_REPOSITORY, else the origin remote)
#   HOOK_PIN_BRANCH    — branch the PR is opened from
#                        (default: hook-pin-bump/update). Deliberately NOT
#                        `skills-lock-bump/update`: this repo's own skills.lock
#                        is in the consumer bumper's scope, so that branch is
#                        already in use here and the two would clobber one
#                        another on alternate nights.

# ── yq preflight ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# THE INCIDENT, and it is one missing guard wearing two costumes. The
# repos.yml reads that decide which repos a run touches — `exclude`,
# `default_sections`, `cron_coverage` and the `skills_bootstrap` block — were
# spelled `yq ... 2>/dev/null || true` (`|| echo ""` for the scalars) in
# sync.sh, drift-report.sh and bump-consumer-locks.sh, which collapses three
# different answers into one: the key is legitimately absent, yq could not
# parse the file, and yq is not installed at all. Only the first is normal;
# `|| true` turned the other two into an EMPTY LIST, exit 0, and not one line
# in the log. An empty exclusion list is not an inert one —
# sync.sh's filter then matches nothing, and the run clones a repo repos.yml
# excludes and pushes the managed AGENTS.md straight to its default branch,
# which is the contamination that exclusion exists to prevent. Measured with
# a `yq` stubbed to exit 1: drift-report.sh printed "Found 1 repo(s)" and
# reported on the excluded repo, where the same run with a working yq printed
# "excluded by repos.yml" and "Found 0 repo(s)".
#
# The second costume is FLAVOUR, and it is why the probe below runs a command
# instead of reading a version string. Two unrelated programs install as
# `yq`: mikefarah's Go one, which this repo's workflows fetch version-pinned
# and digest-verified (docs/decisions/0008; Test 7h holds all four copies of
# that step identical), and kislyuk's Python wrapper around jq, which Debian
# ships as `yq` and which forwards `-o=json` to jq and dies with "jq: Unknown
# option -o=json" — a message that blames repos.yml for a tool problem, and
# the message the nightly hook-pin bump actually died with. `-o=json -I0` is
# the exact invocation bump-hook-pin.sh's round-trip check depends on, so
# probing it asks the question this repo really has, and asks it once, up
# front, rather than letting the answer arrive as an empty array or a
# misattributed parse error halfway down.
#
# THIS BLOCK IS DUPLICATED VERBATIM in sync.sh, drift-report.sh,
# bump-consumer-locks.sh and bump-hook-pin.sh. All four are standalone entry
# points and only one of them sources anything today (a file about pull
# request prose), so a library existing solely to hold this guard would be an
# abstraction invented for one `if`. The four copies must move together.

# pick_diagnostic <producer> <file> — the ONE line of a captured stderr that a
# one-line failure report should quote.
#
# Every caller has the same shape: a command's stderr was redirected to a file
# so the failure could be named without quoting the command's STDOUT, which on
# a gh HTTP error is the API's raw response body — and AGENTS.md ("Sanitize
# error output") forbids putting one of those in a public log. Separating the
# streams settled WHICH STREAM to quote. It left open WHICH LINE, and `head -1`
# is wrong for both producers this repo captures, in OPPOSITE directions. That
# is why the producer is a parameter and not one rule:
#
#   gh    — gh's ordinary notices are `gh: `-prefixed too and are written
#           BEFORE the error it is being asked about, so the first line is the
#           notice and the operator is sent after the wrong fault. gh writes
#           its own status as `gh: <message> (HTTP <code>)`, so that line is
#           preferred, then any `gh: ` line, then the first non-blank line.
#   tool  — python3 and yq write their warnings and traces FIRST and the fatal
#           line LAST: a traceback ends in `SomeError: message`, and argparse
#           prints its `usage:` banner first and `<prog>: error: ...` last. So
#           the LAST non-blank line is the one that says what went wrong.
#
# Measured with the twelve stderr shapes these callers actually see (a
# deprecation notice then `gh: Not Found (HTTP 404)`; an auth-expiry warning
# then `(HTTP 403)`; a bare `(HTTP 401)`; a line gh did not write; empty; a
# yq deprecation then `Error:`; an argparse usage banner then `: error: `; a
# python traceback): `gh` picks the status line in each gh case and `tool` the
# fatal line in each tool case, where plain `head -1` picks the notice and the
# usage banner.
#
# Blank lines are skipped in EVERY branch, which is not tidiness: measured on
# a stderr of "real error\n\n\n", plain `tail -1` quotes the empty string, and
# on "\n\nmock gh: boom\n" plain `head -1` does the same. A producer that pads
# its stderr would otherwise be reported as having said nothing.
#
# An unknown producer returns 2 with a message rather than an empty string,
# because it can only be a construction error here: every call site passes a
# literal.
#
# This is NOT generator_error_line's job, which stays where it is in
# bump-consumer-locks.sh: that one reads a captured STRING of the lock
# generator's MERGED output and additionally knows that generator's own
# `ERROR:` marker. This one reads a stderr FILE.

# spelling collapsed into one: a key that is legitimately absent (yq prints
# nothing and exits 0 — a normal empty result, which each caller's `[[ -n ]]`
# guard already handles), a repos.yml yq cannot parse, and a yq that fell
# over. Only a NON-ZERO EXIT is a failure, and a failure now stops the run,
# because what is read through here decides what a run does to other people's
# repositories — which repos the fleet walkers write to, and which hook every
# session in them then runs: a silently empty answer is not a smaller run, it
# is a run against the wrong set.
#
# Command substitution, never `< <(...)`. Process substitution discards the
# exit status of the command inside it, so simply dropping `|| true` from one
# of those reads would have changed the visible behaviour not at all — the
# same trap named beside the `gh repo list` capture in the scripts that walk
# the fleet. The `exit 2` below leaves only the substitution's subshell on its
# own; what stops the run is `set -e` seeing the assignment that captured it
# come back non-zero, so every caller must assign the result rather than pipe

# the registry against the pin on the DEFAULT branch, and an open PR has not
# changed that, so a second run gets past it and rebuilds the same commit. Same
# parent, same tree, same message — but a later committer timestamp, so a
# different sha, so the push to the branch that already holds last night's
# commit is a non-fast-forward. It would then either fail the run or tempt
# someone into `--force`, which is a force-push over a branch a reviewer may
# have committed to. Neither is acceptable for a nightly job, and both are
# avoided by simply not proposing twice.
# Captured with its exit status, and read only on success. `gh` prints an HTTP
# error body to STDOUT and never runs the --jq filter, so the `2>/dev/null ||
# true` this replaces made "there is no open pull request" and "I could not
# ask" the same empty string — and the refusal further down then stated the
# first as a fact, beside a remedy (delete the branch) that CLOSES an open pull
# request on GitHub and discards whatever review was pending on it. An
# unanswerable question stops the run instead, exactly as
# bump-consumer-locks.sh's sweep already handles it.
#
# Streams captured SEPARATELY, and on this call that is not tidiness — a merged
# capture turns the whole script into a silent no-op. What comes back is DATA,
# not a diagnostic: `.[0].number // empty` prints NOTHING and exits 0 when no
# pull request is open, and the EMPTINESS of that answer is the entire
# decision below. gh writes to stderr while exiting 0 in ordinary conditions —
# deprecation notices, auth-expiry warnings — so `2>&1` makes a night with no
# open PR indistinguishable from a night with one. Measured against this
# script with a gh stubbed to exit 0 having printed no PR: with stderr silent
# it logs "DRY RUN — would re-pin example/registry 0000000 → 78848fd" and
# proposes the bump; with one "gh: warning: authentication token is nearing
# expiry" line on stderr and the same exit 0 it logs "PR #gh: warning:
# authentication token is nearing expiry already proposes a hook pin bump on
# hook-pin-bump/update — leaving it alone", prints "=== Hook pin bump complete:
# already proposed ===" and exits 0 having written nothing. Nothing anywhere
# goes red — scheduled-run-health sees a success — and the pin never advances,

# THE WRITE, and why it is a two-line text edit rather than `yq -i`.
#
# repos.yml is ~90% comment by line count, and every one of those comments is
# load-bearing prose that an ADR points at. mikefarah yq re-serialises the
# document it parsed; comment handling is best-effort and formatting is not
# preserved, so an in-place yq write is a diff across the whole file in which
# the two bytes that matter are invisible. So: rewrite exactly the two scalar
# lines inside the `skills_bootstrap:` block, leave every other byte alone.
#
# A text edit then has to prove it did not do something else, so it does —
# this is register-bootstrap-hook.sh's semantic guard, in the same shape and
# for the same reason. After patching, BOTH documents are parsed and compared
# as data: the result must equal the original with exactly `skills_bootstrap.ref`
# and `skills_bootstrap.sha256` changed and nothing else. A successful write
# provably means "the old file plus those two values" — no key dropped, no list
# reordered, no anchor coerced, no neighbouring block touched. If the
# comparison fails, nothing is written and the run stops.

PR_TITLE="Re-pin the skills-bootstrap hook onto ${TARGET_REF:0:7}"
PR_BODY="The \`skills-bootstrap\` hook changed in \`$PIN_REGISTRY\`, so \
\`repos.yml\`'s \`skills_bootstrap\` pin no longer names the current one.

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| \`ref\` | \`$PIN_REF\` | \`$TARGET_REF\` |
| \`sha256\` | \`$PIN_SHA256\` | \`$TARGET_SHA256\` |

**What merging this does.** \`repos.yml\` is in \`sync.yml\`'s \`paths:\` filter, so \
merging fans the hook at \`${TARGET_REF:0:7}\` into every repo named in \
\`skills_bootstrap.repos\` on the next sync run, overwriting whatever copy each \
one carries. The hook runs at the start of every ephemeral session in those \
repos, which is why this bumper opens a pull request and does not merge it \
itself — see \`docs/decisions/0010-the-hook-pin-is-re-pinned-from-here.md\`.

This repo self-hosts the hook — it is dropped from the sync's own per-repo loop, \
so it can never receive the copy it publishes the pin for — so \
\`$PIN_PATH\` moves in this same commit. Its digest is what \
\`test_self_hosted_hook_pin\` checks against the \`sha256\` above.

**What was checked before proposing it.** The path exists at \
\`${TARGET_REF:0:7}\`, the file is non-empty, and it parses under \`bash -n\`. \
The digest above is computed from the bytes at that commit, not carried over. \
The rewrite touched only \`skills_bootstrap.ref\` and \`skills_bootstrap.sha256\`: \
the patched file was re-parsed and required to equal the original with exactly \
those two values changed, or nothing would have been written.

Opened by \`scripts/bump-hook-pin.sh\` from \`.github/workflows/skills-lock-bump.yml\`."

git commit -m "$PR_TITLE

The nightly lock bumper re-pins every consumer's skills.lock, but the hook that
READS that lock moved only when someone hand-edited repos.yml. This is that
bump, proposed automatically: the hook's bytes changed at $PIN_REGISTRY, so the
recorded ref and digest no longer describe the current one." >/dev/null

# ── Does the branch already carry exactly THIS pin? ────────────────────────
#
# Asked before pushing, and it is the whole difference between a branch that
# outlived its pull request being adopted and being stranded forever. The
# sequence that produced it: one night this script pushes $BRANCH_NAME and then
# `gh pr create` dies — a transient 5xx, a rate limit, an App installation
# holding Contents:write but not Pull requests:write — so the branch exists and
# the pull request does not. The default branch still carries the old pin, so
# every later run gets past anti-churn, finds no OPEN pull request, rebuilds
# the same commit on the same parent with only a later committer timestamp, and
# pushes a non-fast-forward onto its own already-correct branch. The identical
# dead end is reached with no failure at all if somebody simply CLOSES the bump
# PR without deleting its branch. Nothing else reaps this branch — sync.sh's
# stale-branch cleanup is scoped to `agents-md-sync/update` — so the hook pin
# would never be proposed again, while all ten allowlisted repos kept
# delivering the pre-change hook.
#
# So: read the pin the remote branch actually carries and compare it with the
# one this run computed. Equal means that branch already IS the proposal and
# the only thing missing is the pull request, which the step below opens. This
# is bump-consumer-locks.sh's `branch_matches` fall-through, in the same shape
# and for the reason written out beside it there.
#
# Every read sits inside the `if` condition so an unreadable answer — a fetch
# that fails, a branch with no repos.yml, a repos.yml yq cannot parse — leaves
# `branch_matches` false instead of aborting the run under `set -e`. Collapsing
# "cannot tell" into "does not match" is safe in this one direction only: it
# lands on the refusal below, which writes nothing.
