# check-agents-md.sh — Structural validator for a generated AGENTS.md.
#
# Why this exists alongside the "Self-guidance is current" staleness check
# (the diff against `build-agents-md.sh` output) rather than being subsumed
# by it: staleness only proves the file is a FIXED POINT of the regen
# recipe — that regenerating it produces byte-identical output — and a
# doubled file can be a fixed point too.
#
# This actually happened (commit c86465f, carried through dea99d3d, merge
# 81391bd, 2be482e, 7b87581). Some tooling split AGENTS.md on the FIRST
# occurrence of the substring "## Repo-specific additions" instead of the
# real marker LINE. The managed block's own BEGIN header quotes the marker
# verbatim:
#
#   <!-- BEGIN MANAGED SECTION — DO NOT EDIT ABOVE "## Repo-specific additions" -->
#
# — so a first-occurrence split anchors on line 1 of that header, not on the
# real "## Repo-specific additions" heading further down, and treats the
# ENTIRE previous file (the whole prior managed block included) as
# "repo-specific content to preserve". The next regen then PREPENDS a fresh
# managed block on top of that preserved copy, and the file now carries two
# managed blocks — two, sometimes contradictory, copies of the same
# guidance. The corrupted BEGIN header line leaves a telltale truncated
# fragment further down the file: the tail end of that same quoted comment,
# stranded on its own line —
#
#   ## Repo-specific additions" -->
#
# — which starts with the real marker text but is not the marker: it has
# `" -->` trailing after it. That fragment is what invariant 5 below exists
# to catch by name, because it is the single most diagnostic clue for
# "this file suffered a first-occurrence split", as opposed to some other
# way of being malformed.
#
# The doubled file regenerates to itself forever: `build-agents-md.sh`'s
# output is deterministic, and `sed -n '/^## Repo-specific additions/,$p'`
# — anchored at the START of the line but not the END — matches that same
# truncated fragment line first on every subsequent run, so the "repo
# specific" tail it extracts is always the same (corrupted) slice. Nothing
# about the recipe converges toward a fix; nothing about the recipe detects
# the problem either. Only a check that looks at the file's STRUCTURE — how
# many of each marker there are, and in what order — can tell a doubled file
# from a well-formed one, which is what this script does.
#
# Usage: check-agents-md.sh [path ...]   (defaults to AGENTS.md)
#
# Exit 0 if every named file is well-formed. Exit 1 otherwise, printing one
# plain-English line per violated invariant, each naming the file and the
# invariant it broke. No `::error::` annotations are emitted here — the
# calling workflow step adds its own if it wants GitHub Actions to surface
# this as a check annotation.
#
# Invariants (per file):
#   1. Exactly one line equal to "## Repo-specific additions" (whole-line).
#   2. Exactly one line containing "BEGIN MANAGED SECTION".
#   3. Exactly one line containing "END MANAGED SECTION".
#   4. Exactly one line containing "Managed by".
#   5. No line that STARTS WITH the marker text but has trailing characters
#      after it (the truncated-header fingerprint described above).
#   6. The single BEGIN MANAGED SECTION line precedes the single END MANAGED
#      SECTION line, which precedes the single "## Repo-specific additions"
#      line — the ordering sync.sh's parse depends on (managed content
#      above the marker, repo-specific content at-and-below it).
#   7. The file is no larger than Codex's project-doc budget, 32768 bytes.
#
# Invariant 7 is the only one here that is not about structure, and it is the
# only one whose failure is INVISIBLE in a normal session — which is why it is
# checked rather than left to whoever notices. Codex (codex-cli 0.154.0,
# measured 2026-09-14) walks AGENTS.md from the project root down to cwd under
# a running byte budget `project_doc_max_bytes`, default 32768. A file that
# does not fit the remaining budget is not skipped and not reported: it is CUT
# at that byte, with only a `tracing::warn!("project doc exceeds remaining
# budget; truncating")` in `codex-rs/core/src/agents_md.rs` that no ordinary
# session ever sees. Measured 2026-09-14 on cms-platform: `codex debug
# prompt-input` — which renders the model-visible instructions without
# a model call — showed exactly 32,768 bytes of a 55,788-byte AGENTS.md
# (a feature-branch checkout; `main`'s copy was 71,794 bytes), ending
# mid-heading at `## An unapproved gate holds its concu`. Everything
# after that byte, the whole "## Repo-specific additions" half
# included, was simply not there, and nothing in the session said so.
#
# This is a per-FILE check, so it is the one an over-budget repo can act on.
# The budget is a chain total, so a repo with nested AGENTS.md files can still
# truncate while every single file passes; `docs/decisions/0012` records why
# that residual is accepted rather than chased here.
#
# The remedy is always the same and is always the repo's own: trim
# "## Repo-specific additions" and move long-form content to docs/. The managed
# half above the marker is held under budget by this repo's own size tests.
