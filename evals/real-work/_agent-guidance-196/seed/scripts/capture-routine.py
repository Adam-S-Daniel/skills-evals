"""Capture a claude.ai Routine's configuration into a committed, diffable file.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    `docs/routines/guidance-centralization.md` records that nothing watches
    this Routine: it is not a workflow, so it has no run history in Actions,
    nothing goes red when it stops, and both of its failure modes are silent.
    A committed snapshot does not fix that, but it converts two invisible
    things into diffs — a Routine whose configuration was edited, and a
    Routine whose prompt has drifted from the spec it claims to follow.

WHERE THE INPUT COMES FROM
    The claude.ai Routines API. Inside an agent session it is reached through
    the `claude-code-remote` MCP server's `list_triggers` tool, whose response
    is this script's input. Two things about that, both measured 2026-08-29 in
    a hosted Claude Code session, so nobody re-derives them:

      - There is no public REST endpoint to curl. `api.anthropic.com` answers
        a structured 404 for every routines-shaped path tried, and
        `mcp-proxy.anthropic.com` is outside this environment's egress
        allowlist. Do not add a hardcoded URL here on a guess; an unverified
        endpoint in a committed script is worse than no fetcher, because it
        looks like one.
      - A nested `claude -p` does NOT inherit the server. The MCP server is
        provisioned per session by the host, so a subprocess Claude Code
        reports "no MCP server named claude-code-remote is connected" and
        finds no such deferred tool.
      - There is no config to read it out of either. Inside a session that is
        demonstrably using the server, `claude mcp list` answers "No MCP
        servers configured" and `claude mcp get claude-code-remote` answers
        "No MCP server named ...". The server is injected by the host and
        carries no URL any committed script could dial.

    So the fetch is left to the caller, in whichever of the two shapes fits:

      # (a) an agent session that holds the tool: call it, save the response
      python3 scripts/capture-routine.py --id trig_... --input response.json \
          --out docs/routines/<name>.routine.md

      # (b) any command that emits the response on stdout
      python3 scripts/capture-routine.py --id trig_... --out FILE \
          --fetch-cmd some-client routines list --json

EXHAUSTIVE BY REFUSAL
    Every leaf field of the API record is classified in FIELD_POLICY as
    captured, redacted, or deliberately excluded — the same two-key shape
    `repos.yml` uses for cron coverage and skills-bootstrap scope, and for the
    same reason: an allowlist alone cannot be audited for completeness. A leaf
    this script has never seen is a REFUSAL (exit 2) naming the path, not a
    field quietly dropped from a file that still reads as complete.

THE VOLATILE HALF
    `--runtime` prints what the snapshot deliberately leaves out — enabled,
    next run, last fired, last run status, ended/suspension reason — and a
    verdict against the spec's cadence-plus-grace staleness rule. It writes
    nothing, because those fields change on every fire and committing them would make the snapshot
    stale the moment the Routine runs. This is the spec's manual "is it still
    firing" check, in one command.

EXIT CODES
    0  wrote (or, with --check, matched) the snapshot, or printed --runtime
    1  --check found the file stale, or absent
    2  refused: unusable input, routine not found, unclassified field, or an
       internal inconsistency the operator has to decide about

    recreation fires daily — a fixed fortnight would let it sit dead through
    eleven missed fires before saying so.

    Shape-classified, not evaluated: a real cron engine is a dependency this
    script does not need to answer "roughly how often". Every branch rounds UP
    to the worst-case gap between fires, so the verdict can flag late but never
    cry STOPPED early. A shape outside the classification is a Refusal, not a
    guess — the same contract FIELD_POLICY holds for record fields.

    Returns (days, description) for a recurring schedule, or None when nothing
    recurs (one-shot or poke-only) and so nothing can be late.
