 * check-guidance-touch.js — the docs/guidance-impact.md touch gate.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. An edit to a `##` section of agents-md/base.md (or a file
 * under agents-md/sections/) ships on the strength of its PR description.
 * Nothing records what it was measured against, and nothing records a
 * proposal that was tried and turned down, so the next session re-derives
 * it. scripts/check-guidance-coverage.js (_agent-guidance#119) proves every
 * section HAS a manifest row; this script proves that a PR CHANGING a
 * section's content also adds an entry to docs/guidance-impact.md for it.
 *
 * THE JOIN. agents-md/eval-coverage.yml's `id` is the stable key across a
 * heading's own wording changing — see that file's header. This script reads
 * the manifest and the guidance source at both the PR's base and head shas,
 * matches rows by `id` (never by heading text, which a rename changes), and
 * for every id whose section BODY (the extent's text after its own heading
 * line — comparing the heading line itself would flag a pure rename, which
 * needs no entry per the issue's test list) differs between the two commits,
 * requires a new entry for that id in this diff's addition to
 * docs/guidance-impact.md. An id present at head with no counterpart at base
 * is a `create`; an id present at base with no counterpart at head is a
 * `remove` and specifically requires a `remove`-typed entry. An id whose
 * heading text does not resolve to a real heading at its own commit (a stale
 * manifest row, or a heading with no row at all) is left alone — that
 * defect belongs to check-guidance-coverage.js, and reporting it here too
 * would be the same failure reported twice.
 *
 * THE BASE/HEAD SHAS come from $GITHUB_EVENT_PATH
 * (pull_request.base.sha / pull_request.head.sha), read inside this script —
 * never `${{ github.event.pull_request.* }}` interpolated into a workflow
 * `run:` block, which echoes the rendered value into the log.
 *
 * base.sha ITSELF IS NOT WHAT THIS DIFFS FROM. GitHub sets it to the base
 * branch's TIP at event time, not the commit the PR actually forked from —
 * once the base branch advances with its own guidance edit, a two-dot diff
 * against base.sha makes that sibling edit look like part of THIS PR, and
 * this PR gets told to write an entry for a change its author never made.
 * The fix is `git merge-base base.sha head.sha` (needs the checkout's
 * `fetch-depth: 0` in ci.yml — see that step's own comment) and everything
 * below diffs from THAT commit, never from base.sha directly. A merge-base
 * that cannot be resolved (a sha ci.yml's checkout never fetched) is a named
 * exit-2 error, not a raw `git` spawn failure.
 *
 * agents-md/base.md, agents-md/sections/*.md AND agents-md/eval-coverage.yml
 * are all read at both shas via `git show <sha>:<path>` (not the checked-out
 * working tree) — the working tree holds only one commit at a time, and a
 * `pull_request` checkout's default HEAD is a synthetic merge commit, not
 * literally `pull_request.head.sha`.
 *
 * docs/guidance-impact.md itself is parsed structurally: `##` entry headings
 * via the same markdown-it token walk as scripts/lib/markdown-sections.js,
 * and each entry's `- Eval: ...` bullet by matching list-item INLINE TOKENS
 * (never a regex scanning the raw file — a bullet illustrating the format
 * inside the fenced code block under "## Entry format" is a `fence` token,
 * not a list item, so it is never mistaken for a real entry).
 *
 * WHICH ENTRY TYPES SATISFY WHICH TOUCH. A `create` touch needs a `create`
 * entry; an `edit` touch needs an `edit` OR a `rename` entry (a heading
 * reworded alongside a body change is still an edit of the section); a
 * `remove` touch needs a `remove` entry. A `rejected` entry never satisfies
 * any of the three — it records a proposal that did NOT land this way, so it
 * must not stand in for the entry the actually-landed change requires.
 *
 * THE ISSUE'S "unparseable impact file" CASE (exit 2) is implemented here as
 * a manifest missing at BOTH head and the base branch's tip (exit 2, see B1
 * below): markdown-it has no unparseable state — it renders any byte stream
 * to SOME token stream — so there is no parse failure to distinguish from a
 * missing file.
 *
 * B1 — docs/guidance-impact.md (or agents-md/eval-coverage.yml itself)
 * ABSENT AT HEAD is not the same failure as "the author never wrote an
 * entry": a PR forked before either file existed (this repo's own pre-#119
 * history is exactly such a case) has neither on its own branch even though
 * the base branch — which is what will actually receive the merge — already
 * carries both. Treating that as exit 2 ("could not run at all") names the
 * wrong remedy ("must be created") for a file that already exists, just not
 * on this branch yet. So: a manifest missing at head falls back to
 * `pull_request.base.sha` (the base branch's CURRENT tip, distinct from the
 * merge-base) via loadManifestWithFallback — an id is stable across the
 * manifest's own history, so a heading that still resolves at head under a
 * tip row's exact text can be trusted to carry that row's id even though
 * head itself has no manifest file at all. EXACT TEXT ONLY: a tip row whose
 * heading has no exact match at `sha` is a named exit 2 — the message gives
 * the row id, the sha, and the same "merge or rebase onto the base branch"
 * remedy — never an approximate match. Round 3's nearest-heading pass, added
 * so that a rename on a pre-manifest fork would resolve at head too,
 * manufactured a false `remove` on a removal beside a rename, waved a
 * wholesale section rewrite through at exit 0, and crossed two pure renames
 * into two false `edit` demands, so round 4 deleted it rather than tuning it
 * (each measurement is recorded on loadManifestWithFallback itself). The
 * window this fallback serves is closing on its own — branches forked before
 * #121 landed the manifest — and merging the base branch resolves every case
 * the exact pass cannot, by making the manifest exist at both shas. Only
 * when the base tip ALSO has no usable manifest is this the OTHER exit 2,
 * naming "merge or rebase onto the base branch" rather than "create the
 * file". docs/guidance-impact.md absent at head gets the parallel treatment
 * in main() itself: if nothing was touched, absence is moot (exit 0,
 * unchanged); if something was, it is exit 1 (fixable by merging/rebasing and
 * then adding an entry), never exit 2 — the check DID run and DID find
 * something to require.
 *
 * S1 — APPEND-ONLY IS ENFORCED TWO WAYS, independently, because each catches
 * a different failure the other cannot: (1) appendOnlyViolation asserts
 * STRUCTURALLY that every dated entry already present at the merge-base is
 * still there at head, byte-for-byte and in FULL — the heading plus the
 * whole Motivation/Change/Eval/Outcome body (S3), not just its Eval: line —
 * somewhere among head's dated entries, by multiset membership rather than
 * at any fixed position (S4: a legitimate merge re-sorts this file, and the
 * round-2 version, which demanded the base entries survive as an exact
 * trailing block at the end, rejected that while happily accepting the same
 * entries in an order nothing documents). That is what actually catches
 * someone rewording an OLD entry in place instead of appending a new one —
 * anywhere in that entry, and regardless of what date they leave on it; a
 * pure date check could never catch it, since a reworded entry can carry
 * any date, including a perfectly plausible recent one. (2) dateIssue
 * separately rejects a NEW entry whose own date is not real
 * (`2026-13-45`), predates docs/guidance-impact.md's own documented
 * inception (`2026-09-04`; a bare cutoff, not a comparison against the
 * merge-base commit's real timestamp — the latter would flag this repo's
 * own long-standing test fixtures, which fix their entry dates rather than
 * the wall clock the suite runs under), or is in the future relative to the
 * head commit's own date (`2099-01-01`). Both are needed: (1) alone would
 * wave through a garbage date on an honestly-appended new entry, and (2)
 * alone would wave through an in-place rewording that keeps a plausible
 * date.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT CHECK, in both cases deliberately:
 *   - THE ORDER OF ENTRIES. docs/guidance-impact.md's own convention is
 *     newest first, and nothing here enforces it: S4 replaced the positional
 *     append-only compare with multiset membership precisely because a
 *     correct merge re-sorts the file. Ordering is a convention here, not a
 *     gate, and the doc says so too.
 *   - A GARBAGE DATE ON AN ENTRY NO TOUCH NEEDED. dateIssue runs only over
 *     the entries a TOUCHED id's requirement is being satisfied by, so a
 *     "## 2099-01-01 — <id> — edit" added in a diff that touches no section
 *     at all is exit 0. Nothing is being waved through by it: the entry
 *     satisfies no requirement, the append-only invariant still holds over
 *     it, and the id it names was not changed by this diff. Enforcing dates
 *     on entries nobody asked for would mean validating the whole file on
 *     every PR, which is a different check from this one.
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 — every touched id has a sufficient new entry (including: nothing was
 *       touched at all).
 *   1 — a touched id has no new entry, an insufficient one (an Eval: none
 *       line while its manifest row is not `gap`, an `exempt (skipped row)`
 *       line while it is not `skipped`, or a date that fails dateIssue), one
 *       typed to a kind that does not satisfy the touch (a `rejected` entry
 *       against an edit), a removed id's entry not typed `remove`, an
 *       append-only violation (appendOnlyViolation), or
 *       docs/guidance-impact.md missing at head while something was touched
 *       (see B1 above). Errors name the id and the entry format.
 *   2 — could not run at all: no $GITHUB_EVENT_PATH, an unreadable or
 *       unparseable event file, an unresolvable merge-base, a malformed
 *       --repo-root, or agents-md/eval-coverage.yml missing at both head and
 *       the base branch's tip, or a base-tip row that the exact fallback
 *       cannot match to any heading at a sha where the manifest is absent
 *       (see B1 above).

// after three reviews, because every guess it made was wrong in a way that
// wrote something FALSE into the audit trail, and the measurements are worth
// keeping here:
//   - a genuine removal beside a rename (Beta deleted, Gamma renamed) handed
//     Beta's row the only unclaimed heading left and then had nothing for
//     Gamma's, so the gate demanded `gamma — remove`: a RETIREMENT recorded
//     for a section that was renamed;
//   - a section SPLIT ("## Security" -> "## Secrets" carrying the old body,
//     plus an all-new "## Security and secrets") resolved `security` to
//     "Secrets", compared the old body against itself and exited 0 "nothing
//     to require" — a wholesale rewrite through the gate with no entry;
//   - a pure rename whose new heading was farther, by edit distance, than an
//     unrelated unclaimed heading, and two pure renames the greedy walk
//     CROSSED, each produced a false `edit` demand for a section nobody
//     touched.
// The pass was also order-dependent (rows are walked in manifest order) and
// uncapped (no distance ceiling), so none of that was tunable in the small.
// What it bought was a window that is closing on its own — branches forked
// before #121 landed the manifest on 2026-09-04 — and the remedy for every
// case it could not resolve is cheap, correct and unambiguous: merge the base
// branch, after which the manifest exists at both shas and no fallback runs
// at all. So a tip row the exact pass cannot resolve is a named exit 2, not a
// guess.
//
// CONSEQUENCE, and the point of the whole change: no fallback resolution can
// produce a `remove` remedy any more. A row that resolved at the merge-base
// and does not resolve at head is exit 2, never a retirement inferred from
// the asymmetry. Genuine removals — where the manifest is present at BOTH
// shas and the row is really gone from it — keep computeTouched's own
// `remove` path, untouched.
//
// `required` here means "is `sha` missing the manifest with NO usable
// fallback a fatal error" — mirrored from loadManifestAt's own `required`,

//
// BODY BOUNDARY. extractHeadings' endLine runs through the line before the
// NEXT heading, which for every entry but the last also swallows the blank
// lines and `---` thematic break this file's own convention places between
// entries. Left in, that means the exact same entry text gets a DIFFERENT
// computed body depending on whether something happens to follow it before
// the next heading (measured: pasting an existing entry ahead of itself, so
// one copy sits at EOF and the other does not, gave the two byte-for-byte
// copies of the SAME entry two different identities — the copy nearer EOF
// carried no trailing separator, the other did — which broke S2's own
// duplicate-detection on the exact fixture it exists to catch). A trailing
// `hr` (thematic break) token — markdown-it's structural read of a lone
// `---`/`***`/`___` line, never a text scan — truncates the body at ITS OWN
// start line, so an entry's identity no longer depends on what, if anything,
// separates it from its neighbor.
//
// TRAILING, AND ONLY TRAILING (S1, round 4). The first version of this took
// the FIRST hr in the entry's range, which is a different rule wherever an
// entry contains a thematic break of its own: everything below that break —
// an `- Outcome:` line, say — fell outside the computed body and so outside
// appendOnlyViolation's compare entirely, and rewriting it in place came
// back exit 0. So the LAST hr in the range is taken instead, and it
// truncates only when every line after it, up to the next heading, is blank

// counts occurrences, so rewording an OLD entry's body in place (heading
// text unchanged) just makes the old occurrence's count drop to zero and the
// reworded text look like a brand-new addition, satisfying the touch as if a
// real new entry had been appended. This checks the file's actual STRUCTURE

// S4: "somewhere," not "at a fixed trailing position." The round-2 version
