# guidance-impact.md — the fleet-guidance change audit trail

Every change to a `##` section of `agents-md/base.md` or a file under
`agents-md/sections/` gets an entry here — creations, edits, renames,
removals, and **rejected proposals**. The rejected ones are the reason the
file exists: git history records what landed, but nothing records what was
tried and turned down, so the next session re-derives and re-proposes it. An
approach already ruled out is the expensive thing to lose. Modeled on
agentskills' [`docs/skill-impact.md`](https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/agentskills/blob/main/docs/skill-impact.md),
with `<section-id>` (the stable key in `agents-md/eval-coverage.yml`) in
place of `<bundle>/<skill>` — guidance sections have no bundle to sit in.

What this file is NOT for: harness, hook, CI, lock or docs changes that don't
touch a `##` section's own extent. Entries append in the same PR as the
change, newest first — a convention for readers, not a rule the gate checks:
`scripts/check-guidance-touch.js` (CI: the "Guidance touch gate" step in
`ci.yml`) compares entries by membership, never by position, so a merge that
re-sorts them is not a violation. What it does enforce is that a PR touching
a section's extent adds an entry for it here.

**This repo is public and scanned. Nothing sensitive in an entry, ever** — a
sensitive rejection is recorded by PR link alone.

## Entry format

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <section-id> — <create|edit|rename|remove|rejected>
- Motivation: one line — the incident, pattern, or issue that prompted it
- Change: one line — what changed (PR #NNN)
- Eval: a real result naming both what was measured and its outcome — an
  exit code (`exit 0`), a score fraction (`7.0/8`), or a sample size (`n=3`),
  alongside a fixture path, eval id, or report link for context; "none — no
  fixture yet" (legal only while the manifest row is `gap`); or "exempt
  (skipped row)" (legal only while the manifest row is `skipped`). Nothing
  else satisfies this bullet — a placeholder like "TBD" or "TBD (PR #NNN)"
  does not, even though the latter contains a digit.
- Outcome: merged YYYY-MM-DD, or rejected YYYY-MM-DD — one line why. The
  full proposal survives in the closed PR; link it rather than pasting it.
```

Rules:

- **A rejected proposal is the highest-value entry.** Record it even when it
  feels like noise — especially then.
- **Append-only.** A wrong entry gets a correcting entry, not an edit.
- **Whitespace-only changes are still changes.** There is no "small edit"
  exemption — one line in the log costs nothing, and the exemption would be
  the hole every edit walks through.

Entries before 2026-09-04 predate this file and live only in git history —
no backfill is planned; the file adds the fields git does not capture.

## 2026-09-28 — working-in-these-repos — edit
- Motivation: the owner asked that every added or changed text use American English spelling (behavior, not behaviour), fleet-wide across both owners; the managed text itself said "behaviour".
- Change: new bullet requiring American English spelling in all added or changed text, comments and commits included; "New behaviour" → "New behavior". Room made inside the 28 KiB full-build budget by shortening the preamble's truncation sentence (PR #193).
- Eval: none — no fixture yet
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-28

## 2026-09-28 — name-becomes-scanner-data — edit
- Motivation: same owner request; the section said "serialising".
- Change: "serialising" → "serializing", no other change (PR #193).
- Eval: none — no fixture yet
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-28

## 2026-09-28 — two-setup-gaps — edit
- Motivation: bytes for the American English bullet inside the full-build size budget (28,668 of 28,672 before).
- Change: the opening sentence stops restating the heading ("Two setup gaps no repo can commit" → "No repo can commit either"); meaning unchanged (PR #193).
- Eval: none — no fixture yet
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-28

## 2026-09-28 — dependency-updates — edit
- Motivation: the owner reversed "the installed one, else latest" (written with a frequently updated laptop CLI in mind): a runner's preinstalled CLI can be any age, so a run should always install the newest release.
- Change: a run (CI, an eval) installs the harness CLI at npm `latest`, not the installed one, and records the version and models used (PR #188; companions https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/skills-evals/pull/203 and https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/adam-agentskills/pull/29).
- Eval: none — no fixture yet
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-28

## 2026-09-27 — dependency-updates — edit
- Motivation: the owner asked to stop adopting harness releases through manual pin-bump PRs: use the harness the environment already has, else install latest, and record which harness and model versions each run used.
- Change: harness CLIs (Claude Code, Codex; not `uses:` refs or SDK packages) are no longer pinned at all: the installed one, else latest, recording the harness version and the models used. Replaces this PR's earlier "newest release, still exact" wording; the "(they inherit `default-days`)" aside is dropped to stay inside the 28,672-byte full-build cap (PR #186; companions https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/skills-evals/pull/203 and https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/adam-agentskills/pull/28).
- Eval: none — no fixture yet
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-27

## 2026-09-27 — dependency-updates — edit
- Motivation: the owner adopts new model harnesses on day one in practice, and asked the fleet rule to match; the 7-day wait had CI running Claude Code 2.1.211 while `latest` was 2.1.283.
- Change: model harnesses (Claude Code, Codex CLI) skip the 7-day wait for a hand bump and take the newest release, still pinned exact; the rest of the section is reworded to pay for it inside the 28,672-byte full-build cap (PR #186; companion pin bumps in https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/skills-evals/pull/203 and https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/adam-agentskills/pull/28).
- Eval: none — no fixture yet
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-27

## 2026-09-24 — workstation-layout — edit
- Motivation: the public skills registry moved from Adam-S-Daniel/agentskills to Adam-S-Daniel/adam-agentskills (its ADR 0013), and the owner asked for the laptop's hostname to leave the fleet guidance.
- Change: The clone-location bullet names "the owner's Windows laptop" instead of a hostname; the WSL-elevation bullet drops the retired `adam-local` bundle name and keeps the skill name (PR #167)
- Eval: exempt (skipped row)
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-24 (PR #167)

## 2026-09-24 — sessions-get-cut-off — edit
- Motivation: the owner asked for the laptop's hostname to leave the fleet guidance; the full build sits at its 28,672-byte cap, so the added words are paid for in the same PR.
- Change: The opening line names "the owner's laptop" instead of a hostname; "frequently" -> "often" and "the commit message ... or an ADR" -> "a commit message ... or ADR", wording only (PR #167)
- Eval: none — no fixture yet
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-24 (PR #167)

## 2026-09-24 — subagent-delegation — edit
- Motivation: the public skills registry moved to Adam-S-Daniel/adam-agentskills, where `disarm-inherited-reach` ships in the `adam-coding-anywhere` plugin, so `/adam:disarm-inherited-reach` no longer resolves.
- Change: The invocation is now `/adam-coding-anywhere:disarm-inherited-reach`; "(a reviewer once did, unasked)" loses "unasked" to stay inside the byte cap (PR #167)
- Eval: none — no fixture yet
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-24 (PR #167)

## 2026-09-24 — skills-ecosystem — edit
- Motivation: the public skills registry moved from Adam-S-Daniel/agentskills (bundles `adam`, `adam-local`, `fastmail`) to Adam-S-Daniel/adam-agentskills (plugins `adam-anything-anywhere`, `adam-coding-anywhere`, `adam-coding-local`, `adam-non-coding-local`), and agentskills-private was renamed adam-agentskills-private.
- Change: Names the new registry, its four plugins and the `/<plugin>:<skill>` invocation form; ADR citations read "registry ADR NNNN" (same numbers in adam-agentskills); the private registry's new name; "at session start" -> "at start" for the byte cap (PR #167)
- Eval: none — no fixture yet
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-24 (PR #167)

## 2026-09-24 — two-setup-gaps — edit
- Motivation: the marketplace a durable machine adds and updates is now adam-agentskills, the multi-repo snippet lives in that repo, and the owner asked for the laptop's hostname to leave the fleet guidance.
- Change: `marketplace add`/`update` name adam-agentskills; the snippet's home names adam-agentskills; the INSTALL example names "the owner's laptop"; small wording trims ("Once per session", "unset in", "never assume it", "yet says it did") keep the full build inside its 28,672-byte cap (PR #167)
- Eval: none — no fixture yet
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-24 (PR #167)

## 2026-09-22 — skills-ecosystem — edit
- Motivation: Claude Code 2.1.273+ syncs the claude.ai account store into terminal sessions too (agentskills issue #158); the section still read as though that channel were cloud-only.
- Change: Added the terminals bullet (setup.sh opts a machine out, cloud sessions can't; agentskills' ADR 0010) and tightened the section's other bullets, wording only, so the full build stays at the 28,672-byte cap; section 1274 -> 1287 bytes (PR #153)
- Eval: none — no fixture yet
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-22 (PR #153)

## 2026-09-15 — two-github-connectors — edit
- Motivation: room for the closing-keyword rule (_agent-guidance#132): the full build with every section was 28,648 of the suite's 28,672-byte ceiling.
- Change: Drops "a 404 means not visible to THIS connector — re-check on the other", which the adjacent 404 section already says (PR #137)
- Eval: none — no fixture yet
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-15 (PR #137)

## 2026-09-15 — fleet-spans-two-owners — edit
- Motivation: room for the closing-keyword rule (_agent-guidance#132), same size budget as the two-github-connectors entry.
- Change: Folds the "Enumerate owners; never hardcode one" bullet into the intro sentence that already names `SYNC_OWNERS` (PR #137)
- Eval: none — no fixture yet
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-15 (PR #137)

## 2026-09-15 — dependency-updates — edit
- Motivation: the section prescribed `semver-major-days: 30` for every ecosystem with no exception; GitHub rejects that key on `github-actions` as a schema error, and four repos ran zero Dependabot updates from 2026-08-10 until found (#133).
- Change: restricts `semver-major-days` to ecosystems that support SemVer cooldown and states it is never valid on `github-actions` (PR #136)
- Eval: none — no fixture yet
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-15 (PR #136)

## 2026-09-15 — git-practices — edit
- Motivation: cms-platform#434's body put a closing keyword before the full URL of _agent-guidance#136, a PR in another repo, and merging #434 left that PR closed unmerged; the rule from PR #137 named only issue numbers (_agent-guidance#132).
- Change: The closing-keyword bullet now covers full issue/PR URLs in any repo, says a PR is closed too, and no longer implies backticks protect anything (PR #142)
- Eval: scratch tests 2026-09-15, n=6, one per case: a keyword before a full URL closed its target 4/4 where no backtick touched the URL (same-repo issue and cross-repo PR from a PR body; cross-repo PR from a commit message, plain and in backticks with a trailing space) and 0/2 where one did (PR-body code span; commit-message backticks abutting the URL) — https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/_agent-guidance/issues/132
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-15 (PR #142)

## 2026-09-15 — git-practices — edit
- Motivation: cms-platform#283 closed unfixed through merge commit `78617e1`, whose hand-written message quoted the closing keyword in a code span (_agent-guidance#132).
- Change: Adds the closing-keyword rule and tightens the squash bullet so the full build stays under its 28,672-byte ceiling (PR #137)
- Eval: scratch-claude-001 tests, n=6, one per case: a code span in a commit message closed its issue 3/3 (branch commit, merge-time `--body`, `PR_BODY` merge commit); a PR body closed 1/1 plain and 1/1 in double quotes, 0/1 in a code span — https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/_agent-guidance/issues/132#issuecomment-5687434470
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-15 (PR #137)

## 2026-09-14 — finding-your-unknowns — edit
- Motivation: a memory note written this session held facts that lived only on a PR branch; nothing checked the "never the only copy" rule.
- Change: States the memory-home contract (metadata.home) and the Stop gate that enforces it (PR #128)
- Eval: none — no fixture yet
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-14 (PR #128)

## 2026-09-14 — working-in-these-repos — edit
- Motivation: Codex 0.154 truncates project instructions at 32,768 bytes (`project_doc_max_bytes`) silently; base.md alone was 55,954 bytes.
- Change: Condensed from 1366 to 862 bytes (section) so the full-mode AGENTS.md and the ~/.codex/AGENTS.md copy fit Codex's project-doc budget (PR #128)

- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-14 (PR #128)

## 2026-09-24 — git-practices — edit
- Motivation: agentskills#179 said "For #176", so merging it left #176 open for a manual close.
- Change: The closing-keyword bullet now says `Closes #N`, not `For #N`, when closing is meant; net −2 bytes (dropped the `--body`/`PR_BODY` aside) because the full build sat at its 28672-byte budget.
- Eval: none — no fixture yet
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-24

## 2026-09-24 — subagent-delegation — edit
- Motivation: a delegated `_agent-guidance#163` check ran `bash test/run-tests.sh; echo "Exit code: $?"`, printed `Exit code: 1` and `1409 passed, 2 failed`, and reported "exit code 0" — the tool's code for the trailing `echo`. The parent caught it by re-running.
- Change: The verifier bullet now says to run the verifier LAST in the delegated command and to re-run a self-contradicting report; the section was trimmed elsewhere to fit, net +2 bytes (the full build was at its 28672-byte budget).
- Eval: none — no fixture yet
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-24

## 2026-09-28 — automation-vs-branch-protection — edit
- Motivation: repo-settings#51 — skills-evals' roster PR (opened and auto-merged with GITHUB_TOKEN behind the required `test` check) became the declared exception to "PR + auto-merge is not a sanctioned bot-write path"; the rule said the opposite with no exception.
- Change: the auto-merge bullet names the exception and cites repo-settings ADR 0003 (PR #191); three phrases trimmed to fit, net +1 byte, full build 28668 of 28672.
- Eval: none — no fixture yet
- Outcome: pending — opened 2026-09-28
