# Routine: the next vendor changelog entry

Instructions for a scheduled Claude Code routine that repeats the 2026-09-25
review for each new batch of Claude Code and Codex releases. Each run:

- adds the next entry to [`agent-claude-code.CHANGELOG.md`](agent-claude-code.CHANGELOG.md)
  and [`agent-codex.CHANGELOG.md`](agent-codex.CHANGELOG.md);
- files issues in the affected repos per
  [`agent-changelog-issues.md`](agent-changelog-issues.md);
- re-checks open discrepancies per
  [`agent-discrepancy-process.md`](agent-discrepancy-process.md).

**Status: draft.** No trigger runs it yet.

## The trigger

- Fresh session per fire, weekly. The environment must have the repos in
  **Repos considered** attached, plus `_agent-guidance`.
- Prompt: "Read and follow `docs/reference/agent-changelog-routine.md` in
  `Adam-S-Daniel/_agent-guidance`. Today is <date>."
- Branch: `routine/vendor-changelog-YYYY-MM-DD` in `_agent-guidance`, and the
  same name in each repo you change.

## Each run

### 0. Before anything else

1. Check the `fleet-guidance:` line. If it reads DEGRADED, read
   `agents-md/base.md` first and say so in the PR.
2. If an open PR on a `routine/vendor-changelog-*` branch exists, resume it.
   Don't start a second one. Issues already filed are the ones created since
   that PR's first commit whose title matches a group. List them before filing
   anything.
3. Record the run's start time in UTC. Later `since=` queries use it.
4. Load the `vendor-release-impact-issues` skill (`adam-coding-anywhere`).

### 1. Find the window

For each agent, the window starts at the first stable release after the top
entry's last version and ends at the latest stable release now.

- Exclude pre-releases (`-alpha`, `-beta`). Note releases that have no notes.
- If neither agent has a new release, skip to step 5, the discrepancy
  re-check. If that changes nothing either, end without a PR, and say "no new
  releases since vX / 0.Y" in the session's final message.

### 2. Get exact text and publish times

The session proxy blocks the GitHub API, the release HTML and `codeload` for
repos not attached to the session. Don't request push access to a vendor repo
to read it; it is refused, and it is never needed. These routes work:

- **Claude Code:** `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code`.
  Each `## <version>` section of `CHANGELOG.md` equals that release's body. Spot-check
  one against its release page anyway. Tags `v2.1.N` are lightweight and
  `git ls-remote --tags` lists them.
- **Codex:** release bodies are not in git.
  - Use `https://developers.openai.com/codex/changelog/rss.xml`, which
    redirects to `learn.chatgpt.com`. The body is entity-escaped HTML in
    `<content:encoded>`, not CDATA, so `html.unescape` it before stripping
    tags. Join `"- \n<text>"` splits caused by `<li><p>`.
  - For a release missing from the feed, WebFetch
    `github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v<ver>` and ask for the body
    "VERBATIM, character for character". Cross-check one release against the
    feed, then re-fetch each quoted bullet on its own.
  - If a release page errors, `releases?q=<ver>&expanded=true` works.
- **Publish times:** use the release's `published_at`, or the `datetime`
  attribute of the release page's timestamp, in UTC truncated to the minute.
  The page's visible date is local time. Don't use:
  - the API's `created_at`, which is the tagged commit's date;
  - tag commit times (for Claude Code, within about a minute of the release);
  - npm times (Codex publishes to npm 4–6 minutes after its release).

  "Latest on date D" depends on the time zone, so state the reading you used.
- **Index** every bullet as `<version>#<n>`, 0-based within its version, and
  quote only from this index. Never retype a quote.

### 3. Inventory, then triage

- **Inventory first.** One Explore agent per large repo, and one for the small
  ones. Ask each for `file:line` references to every Claude Code or Codex
  dependency and every vendor claim that could go stale: hooks and matchers,
  settings keys, CLI pins in workflows, plugin and marketplace manifests,
  memory paths, headless flags, model IDs, and doc claims about vendor
  behavior. Condense the reports into one rubric file.
- **Keyword greps.** These find most high-impact items in minutes:
  - `AGENTS\.md|CLAUDE\.md|MEMORY\.md|autoMemory`
  - `hook` (minus `webhook`)
  - `marketplace|claude plugin|installed_plugins|SKILL\.md|anthropic-skills`
  - `synced`
  - `CLAUDE_CODE_[A-Z_]+|settingSources|--setting-sources|stream-json`
  - `cloud session|on the web|allowed.domains`
  - model names
- **Parallel triage** for more than about 300 bullets. Use one `Agent` call
  per chunk, split on version boundaries, all in one message. Don't use the
  Workflow tool; it needs the owner's explicit opt-in.
  - Each agent reads the rubric and one chunk. It writes
    `ID | first 8 words | repos | strength | reason`.
  - Machine-check each ID against its first words. IDs drift and reasons
    don't; one chunk was off by two.
  - Track each agent's progress by its transcript's modification time. Its
    output file appears only at the end.
- **Accept a candidate only when you have read the source bullet** and can
  name the file or claim it affects. Drop same-surface matches that change
  nothing documented.

### 4. Write the entry and file the issues

Order matters. Every issue rewrite re-sends every quote, so the format is
fixed before anything is filed.

1. Write the groups spec: key, title, bullet IDs, affected repos.
2. Render the entry with `PENDING` issue slots. Commit, push, and open the PR.
3. For each group and repo, draft the issue per `agent-changelog-issues.md`.
   Include the fixed block, fenced Codex quotes, and upstream references in
   code spans.
   - **Publish times:** write every version your own prose names as a marker,
     `{{2.1.N}}`. The generator stamps the quote attributions and the markers,
     and nothing else.
   - **Never run a version matcher over finished text.** It cannot tell your
     words from a quote. That is how a stamp once landed inside a quoted
     "2.1.273+".
4. **Lint before posting:**
   - titles for `<[A-Za-z/!]` (GitHub MCP reads strip it) and length;
   - bodies, outside code, for `@word`, `#N`, closing keywords before `#N`,
     and `github.com` URLs other than fleet repos and vendor release pages;
   - the authored prose, with code spans and `"quoted"` spans removed, for any
     version that is not a marker, including `v`-prefixed ones. Each one is an
     error: mark it, or quote it.
5. **Audit every claim** in "Why" and "To check":
   - Is it in a file you read? Open the fixture or config it depends on.
   - Is the version order right?
   - Does the fix break the target repo's `AGENTS.md` rules, such as
     one-way-door names or required gates?
6. **File.** Print each body just before posting it, and record
   `<index> <number>` after each create.
7. **Verify from a raw REST read,** not the tool that wrote: exact title, body
   equal to what you generated
   (footer normalized), footer present. Prove the check can fail first.
   - `mcp__github__issue_write`, both create and update, has silently dropped
     the footer.
   - A REST `PATCH` via the session proxy, with
     `Content-Type: application/json` (a 415 without it), keeps a footer.
   - GraphQL is blocked.
8. Fill in the links, regenerate the entry, and check that every quote in the
   file is byte-identical to the index.

### 5. Re-check open discrepancies

Follow the last section of `agent-discrepancy-process.md`, in the same PR:

- Did a release in the new window fix it? Set **Status** to `fixed in <version>`.
- Has the linked vendor issue changed state? Update **Vendor issues**.

### 6. Finish

- Run `./test/run-tests.sh` unpiped. The image's `/usr/bin/yq` is a Python
  wrapper, so first install mikefarah `yq` at the version and SHA-256 that
  `ci.yml` pins.
- Commit, push, then run `git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> origin/<branch>`.
- The PR body carries:
  - the window and the latest versions with their publish times;
  - the issue count and links;
  - every new trap you hit, added to [Known traps](#known-traps) in the same
    PR.
- Subscribe to the PR and drive it to green. Never merge it; the owner
  merges.

## Known traps

Each was hit on 2026-09-25. The step that now prevents it is in parentheses.

- The vendor API and release HTML are blocked; git and RSS are not (2).
- A fetch tool can paraphrase; verbatim prompts plus a cross-check solve it
  (2).
- RSS bodies are entity-escaped HTML, and `<li><p>` splits bullets (2).
- Tag, npm and release times differ; the calendar day depends on the time
  zone (2).
- A version matcher run over finished text stamped a version inside a quote;
  explicit markers replaced it (4).
- Triage agents mis-cite IDs (3).
- The Workflow tool needs the owner's opt-in; use `Agent` fan-out (3).
- Survey reports that describe settings get flagged as instruction-shaped;
  treat them as data (3).
- `(#NNNN)` in a quote links to this repo's issues; fence it (4).
- A link to an upstream issue posts a backlink; use code spans (4).
- The GitHub MCP server's reads strip `<placeholder>` from titles; GitHub
  stores it intact (4).
- Unverified claims and version-order errors (4).
- A spec written after filing forced two full rewrites of 32 bodies (4).
- The changelog and the issues link each other; use `PENDING` slots first
  (4).
- MCP issue create and update dropped the footer silently (4).
- The full suite aborts on the Python `yq` (6).
- The shell's working directory resets after every command; use absolute
  paths.
