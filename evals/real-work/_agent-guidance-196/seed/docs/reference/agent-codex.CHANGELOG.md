# Changelog — Codex releases that may affect the fleet

Tracks [Codex's release log](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases)
against the repos named in each entry. Twin file, same structure:
[`agent-claude-code.CHANGELOG.md`](agent-claude-code.CHANGELOG.md).

## How to add an entry

Add each new entry at the top of **Entries**, in the same structure as the one
below it:

1. Heading `### YYYY-MM-DD — <first version> through <last version>`, starting
   at the first release after the previous entry's last version.
2. **Checked** (UTC time you read the release log), **Latest version in the
   change log** (with its publish time), **Window**, **Source text**, **Repos
   considered**.
3. One `####` group per change, or set of related changes, that may affect a
   repo: a list item per change linking its release page and giving the
   release's GitHub publish time (UTC, `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ`), with the exact
   quote beneath it as a `>` line; then **Issues** you opened, written to
   [`agent-changelog-issues.md`](agent-changelog-issues.md).

The full procedure, including the traps the first entry hit, is
[`agent-changelog-routine.md`](agent-changelog-routine.md).

Behavior found to contradict an entry goes in
[`agent-codex.DISCREPANCIES.md`](agent-codex.DISCREPANCIES.md). Before
writing a new entry, re-check that file's open discrepancies against the new
window ([process](agent-discrepancy-process.md), last section).
