/*
 * admin/one-door-publish.js — PRODUCTION SHELL ONLY. Closes the second,
 * unlabelled door to production.
 *
 * ── The defect ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * On this platform there are two routes to the live site and only one of
 * them is called "Publish":
 *
 *   1. Publish → "Publish now". Decap's synchronous merge 422s against the
 *      branch ruleset; publish-via-auto-merge.js converts that into a
 *      `cms/ready` label and cms-editorial-workflow.yml's
 *      `auto-merge-when-ready` job lands it.
 *   2. Status → "Ready". Decap's `setPullRequestStatus` replaces the PR's
 *      CMS label with `decap-cms/pending_publish`, and that SAME
 *      `auto-merge-when-ready` job fires on exactly that label name. So
 *      setting a status an editor reasonably reads as a private
 *      note-to-self publishes the entry.
 *
 * Worse, Decap gates its OWN Publish on that same status, and says so only
 * after refusing. The Workflow board's `WorkflowList.requestPublish` alerts
 * "Only items with a 'Ready' status can be published…", and the entry
 * editor's `handlePublishEntry` alerts `Please update status to "Ready"
 * before publishing.` — the editor's dropdown RENDERS whatever the status,
 * which is why this header once said it had no gate; the gate is in its
 * handler. See docs/PUBLISHING-UX.md §2.1 and §2.2.
 *
 * This shim hides route 2 on the production shell: the toolbar Status
 * dropdown, the Workflow nav link, and the `#/workflow` route itself.
 * Publish becomes the only way to production, which is what makes the
 * one-sentence instruction in publish-step-hint.js true rather than
 * merely simplified.
 *
 * Hiding the Status control also removes the only way to satisfy Decap's
 * editor gate, so Decap's own "Publish now" must never reach its handler on
 * this shell. publish-button.js owns that: it replaces Decap's split button
 * once the entry's PR is known, and before then it intercepts a selection
 * in Decap's Publish dropdown and runs the same `cms/ready` route (the
 * 2026-10-05 jodidaniel.com report: an "Expertise" entry, saved, then
 * "Publish now" → the Ready alert, with no Status control to answer it).
 *
 * ── What it COSTS, stated plainly ──────────────────────────────────────
 * `pending_review` becomes unreachable from the production editor. Nothing
 * on this platform consumes it — there is no notification, no queue and no
 * required reviewer, and the two-person teams these sites are built for
 * send each other a preview link instead. The editorial-label audit
 * (scripts/audit-editorial-labels.js) keys on `decap-cms/*` generally, not
 * on which of the three it is, so `decap-cms/draft` keeps satisfying it and
 * the "adding labels…" dialog stays closed.
 *
 * This removes a capability rather than fixing a defect, so it was staged
 * as an explicit operator decision in docs/PUBLISHING-UX.md phase 2. The
 * decision is recorded there.
 *
 * ── Scope: index.html ONLY ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Deliberately not loaded by the other two shells, and the lint asserts
 * the negative (e2e/admin-329-shims.test.js):
 *
 *   - index-test.html is the REHEARSAL surface. e2e/cms-editorial-workflow.spec.js
 *     and e2e/cms-workflow-states.spec.js drive Decap's real Status control
 *     and the real board against the in-browser test-repo backend; hiding
 *     them there would delete the coverage that tells us Decap still works
 *     the way this shim assumes it does.
 *   - index-local.html has no editorial workflow at all
 *     (config-local.base.yml sets no `publish_mode`), so there is no Status
 *     control and no board to hide — loading this there would be a no-op
 *     that implied otherwise.
 *
 * ── Why CSS-hide and never removeChild ─────────────────────────────────
 * The native-preview-href.js precedent, and it is a measured one: Decap is
 * React-driven and re-mounts elements it owns when it finds them missing,
 * which the observer then re-removes — a fight loop that wedged the editor
 * mid-flow on the failed prod-mutate and host-loop runs at commit 503365a.
 * `display:none` leaves the node exactly where React expects it, and React
 * does not observe inline styles, so reconciliation is a no-op.
 *
 * ── Why the ROUTE too, not just the nav link ───────────────────────────
 * Hiding the link is not hiding the board: `#/workflow` stays reachable
 * from a bookmark, from browser history, and from Decap's own post-action
 * redirects. A door you can still walk through is not closed, and the board
 * is the surface carrying the contradictory rule. So the hash is rewritten
 * to the site root when it lands on the workflow route.
 *
 * `location.replace` is used rather than an assignment so the skipped route
 * does not become a history entry the Back button drops the editor onto —
 * the same reasoning single-entry-collection-shortcut.js documents.
 *
 * ── Failure mode, and what is actually testable ────────────────────────
 * If a future Decap release renames either control, the selectors simply
 * stop matching and nothing is hidden: the admin degrades to today's
 * two-door behaviour, never to a page error.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO browser spec for this shim, and the reason is
 * worth stating rather than leaving as an apparent gap. A browser spec in
 * this suite drives a SERVED admin shell, and the only served shell that
 * loads this file is production — index-test.html must keep exercising
 * Decap's real Status control and board (that is the coverage this shim
 * relies on), and index-local.html has no editorial workflow at all. A
 * spec that read this file off the platform source tree and injected it
 * into a synthetic page would also break the consumer-context rule the
 * moment it ran on a consumer lane.
 *
 * So the parts most likely to break — the two ROUTE MATCHERS, which are
 * pure string functions and exactly the kind of thing a Decap router
 * change moves — are exported for unit testing on
 * `window.__oneDoorPublish`, the same way oauth-app-restriction-detector.js
 * exports its pure matcher. e2e/admin-publish-routing.test.js exercises
 * them with no browser; e2e/admin-publishing-ux.test.js holds the
 * structural half.
