# Admin delivery: the gem-shipped Decap config

What this is: how the `/admin` Decap config is built — the gem-shipped
machinery under `theme/admin/`, the `:post_write` render hook that copies it
into `_site/admin` and renders `config.yml`, the site-owned collections seam,
the `base_collections` keep-list opt-out, and the `field_library` + `$ref`
reuse mechanism. Read this before touching `theme/admin/`, either render path
(`theme/lib/cms-platform-theme/decap_config_hook.rb` or
`scripts/render-decap-config.rb`), `theme/admin/field_library.yml`, or a
site's `admin/collections.site.yml` seam. See also the `admin-config-render`
skill.

This is also the doc that carries the two other gem-shipped-asset patterns
below — the favicon (#325) and the seeded 404 page (#326) — because it's the
one doc a change to `theme/**` is scoped to edit; neither is `/admin`
machinery, but both extend the same "gem ships a neutral, site-shadowable
default" pattern this file already documents for the logo.

## Admin delivery (gem-shipped, v0.1.4+) — the render hook, the seam, base_collections

The Decap admin (`/admin`) is the ~400-line invariant-heavy CMS config plus a
set of JS/HTML/CSS shells and the `reviews/` dashboards. Two facts drive the
whole design:

1. **The gem root is `theme/`** (the gemspec lives there). For the gem to ship
   the admin machinery, `admin/` had to live **under** the gem root, so it was
   relocated from the repo root to `theme/admin/` in **v0.1.4**. (RubyGems drops
   `..` paths and won't follow symlinks, so a sibling `admin/` couldn't be
   packaged.) The gemspec packages `admin/**/*` **minus** the site-owned seam and
   the build-generated files (`collections.site.yml`, `config.yml`,
   `config-local.yml`, `commit.json`) — via `Dir[] - Dir[]` array subtraction,
   because `Dir[]` has no `!` negation.

2. **Consumers stop vendoring `admin/`.** A consuming site deletes its vendored
   `admin/` and keeps **only** the seam `admin/collections.site.yml` (+
   `.example`). The down-sync path is a gem bump via `platform-bump` — since
   #242, Dependabot's `bundler` ecosystem carries an explicit `ignore` for the
   `cms-platform-theme` gem and never touches it (see `docs/SYNC.md`).
   `platform-drift-guard` was narrowed to **skills-only** when admin stopped
   being byte-guarded, and was deleted outright in v0.1.83 along with the skills
   mirror it was left guarding — nothing byte-compares a consumer's tree today.

**The render hook** (`theme/lib/cms-platform-theme/decap_config_hook.rb`, a
`:site, :post_write` Jekyll hook) does, at the end of every build:

- **Resolve machinery inputs from the gem** (`site.theme.root/admin`), falling
  back to a vendored `site.source/admin` (migration window + the platform's own
  e2e fixture). No-op if neither has a `config.base.yml`.
- **Copy the gem-resident machinery into `_site/admin`** — Jekyll won't, since
  the site tree no longer contains `admin/`. It copies depth-1 files + the
  `reviews/` subdir only (skipping `*.base.yml`, the seam, `README.md`). **If you
  add another subdirectory under `theme/admin/`, extend this copy AND its parity
  sibling `scripts/render-decap-config.rb`.**
- **Render `config.yml` AND `config-local.yml` from their `.base.yml`
  templates** by token-substituting the `window.CMS_*` identity
  (`{{CMS_REPO}}`, `{{CMS_OAUTH_BASE_URL}}`, `{{CMS_SITE_URL}}`,
  `{{CMS_DISPLAY_URL}}`, `{{CMS_LOGO_URL}}`) and **splicing the SITE-OWNED
  seam** `admin/collections.site.yml` at each template's own
  `# __SITE_COLLECTIONS__` marker — both `config.base.yml` and
  `config-local.base.yml` carry one, so a site's own collections reach LOCAL
  dev too, not just prod. The seam is read from the **SITE source**, never
  the gem. Before the splice, the seam's `$ref`s are expanded against the
  platform `field_library` (see "field_library + `$ref` reuse" below) — the
  base config itself stays TEXT and is spliced byte-for-byte as today.
- **Inject `window.CMS_*` globals** into the admin shells (`index*.html`) AND the
  reviews dashboards (`reviews/*.html`) — skipping a file only if it already
  *defines* the identity, not merely uses it.
  `CMS_REPO` / `CMS_SITE_ORIGIN` / `CMS_ADMIN_ORIGIN` (#517, `""` unless
  `cms.admin_origin` is set) / `CMS_APEX` / `CMS_OAUTH_BASE_URL` /
  `CMS_SITE_TITLE` are strings; **`CMS_SITE_GATE` (v0.1.96) is an OBJECT or
  `null`** — the site-level publish gate a site optionally declares as
  `cms.site_gate`, read by `admin/site-gate-banner.js`. It is the one global
  that must be serialised with `JSON.generate` rather than the `.inspect` the
  others use: Ruby's `Hash#inspect` emits `{"a"=>1}`, which is a JavaScript
  syntax error, and it lands *inside* the shell's `<script>` block — so
  getting it wrong takes the whole admin down rather than degrading. A site
  with no gate injects `null` and the banner is inert.
  **`CMS_PRODUCTION_BRANCH` (v0.1.107)** is a string again, but it is not
  read from `_config.yml`: it is `backend.branch` of the `config.yml` the
  render path has *just written*, read back with a real YAML parse — the
  branch the admin binds to when that file is served unpatched, i.e. from
  production. `deploy-preview.yml` later patches the SERVED copy to the PR
  head, and `admin/branch-binding-banner.js` compares the two to say, on a
  preview admin, which branch it is bound to (#412). Unreadable → `""`, and
  the banner stays inert rather than the build failing over an advisory
  value. Both paths `require "date"` explicitly for the parse's
  `permitted_classes` — Psych loads it lazily, and without the require the
  first call NameErrors into the rescue and injects `""` (measured on the
  CLI mirror while it was written).
- **Delete `*.base.yml`** from the output (the templates aren't published).

`scripts/render-decap-config.rb` is the **deploy-time CLI mirror** of the hook
(same copy + render + inject + cleanup; resolves the gem via
`Gem.loaded_specs['cms-platform-theme']`). The two are **parity-locked** by
`e2e/decap-config-render-parity.test.js` — keep the injected globals and the
`index*` / `reviews/*` globs **identical** in both, or the lint fails.

**`write-commit-json.sh`** writes `_site/admin/commit.json` (the commit pill's
`fetch('commit.json')` resolves under `_site/admin/` now that admin is served
from there; CI deploys do this automatically — the script is for local dev).

### base_collections opt-out (v0.1.7)

`_config.yml` `cms.base_collections` is a **KEEP-LIST** of the platform's
built-in collections (`posts tags projects pages e2e`):

- **UNSET** → keep all (default, back-compat).
- `[]` → hide them all, so `/admin` shows ONLY the site's own collections.
- a subset → keep only those.

The renderers delete each unwanted top-level collection block by regex —
matched at **2-space indent**, through to the next top-level `- name:` or EOF;
nested fields are deeper-indented so they survive. **Spec-locked** by
`theme/spec/base_collections_filter_test.rb` (asserts nil keeps all, `[]` hides
all base collections but keeps site collections, partial keep works, survivors'
nested fields and a field literally named like a base collection are untouched,
output stays valid YAML). Used by single-page sites (jodidaniel.com).

### field_library + `$ref` reuse (#5 GOAL 2)

A site's seam `admin/collections.site.yml` can **reuse** platform-defined
field/widget defs instead of re-authoring them, by writing a `$ref` where a
field (or fields) would go:

```yaml
  - name: articles
    folder: _articles
    fields:
      - { name: title, label: Title, widget: string }   # inline still works
      - $ref: "#/field_library/body_markdown"            # → ONE field
      - $ref: "#/field_library/image_widget"             # → ONE field
      - $ref: "#/field_library/published_pair"           # → TWO fields (spliced)
```

- **The platform OWNS the library:** `theme/admin/field_library.yml` (ships in
  the gem next to `config.base.yml`, packaged by the `admin/**/*` glob). It
  defines `body_markdown` (markdown body, modes rich_text+raw), `published_pair`
  (the published + publish_date pair — a **list** of 2 fields), `date_widget`,
  `image_widget` (flat-public_folder contract), and `archived_pdf_fields`
  (private-archive file name + permission toggle + optional button label). The
  datetime `format:` token
  (`"YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss ZZ"`) is copied **verbatim** from `config.base.yml`
  (the dayjs/INVALID-DATE cross-engine contract) — keep them in lockstep.
- **Resolved at RENDER time, in BOTH paths.** The shared resolver
  `theme/lib/cms-platform-theme/field_library.rb`
  (`CmsPlatformTheme::FieldLibrary`) is `require`d by **both** render paths and
  invoked identically — `expand_seam_text(raw, field_library_path)` — so they
  stay byte-in-lockstep. It parses the seam, replaces each
  `{"$ref" => "#/field_library/<name>"}` with a **deep copy** of the lib entry
  (single field → one item; list → spliced in place, 2-space list indent
  preserved), then re-emits YAML and splices at the marker. **Decap never sees a
  `$ref`** — it loads only fully-resolved field defs. An unknown / malformed
  `$ref` **fails HARD** (the render aborts; a `$ref` must never leak).
- **The base config stays TEXT.** This is a LOW-RISK increment: only the
  **seam** is YAML-round-tripped (and only when it actually contains a `$ref`).
  `config.base.yml` is byte-unchanged and still spliced verbatim, so every
  load-bearing comment + verbatim-asserted base line (posts.summary, the format
  token, media_folder/public_folder, preview_context) is preserved.
- **Backward-compatible.** A seam with **no** `$ref` (inline fields — the status
  quo, e.g. adamdaniel's notes, jodidaniel's collections) is returned UNCHANGED
  by `expand_seam_text` and spliced exactly as before — **byte-identical**
  renders. Proven by diffing the new vs origin/main render of jodidaniel's real
  inline `collections.site.yml`.
- **Spec-locked** by `theme/spec/field_library_resolution_test.rb` (the resolver:
  single + multi-field refs, deep-copy isolation, hard-fail on unknown/malformed)
  + `e2e/field-library-ref-render.test.js` (drives `render-decap-config.rb` on a
  `$ref` fixture → resolved output, no `$ref` leak, base unchanged, hard-fail,
  no-ref backward-compat). The `$ref`-render spec reads platform `scripts/` +
  `theme/` source, so it's registered in `PLATFORM_META_SPECS` (playwright.config.js).
- **OUT OF SCOPE / future work:** the full base-collection-override **deep-merge**
  (a site overriding/reordering a base collection's fields) is deferred. Today
  the seam is still **append-only** (collections are spliced after the base);
  `$ref` only delivers shared-field REUSE, not base override.

`archived_pdf_fields` is a list-valued ref, so a site opts in with one field
list item and receives `pdf_archive_file`, `pdf_public`, then `pdf_label` in
that order. The archive name stays optional and accepts only a `.pdf` suffix;
the publishing toggle stays optional and defaults to `false`. Its reusable copy
is deliberately site-neutral. The suffix pattern is written `[.]pdf$`,
equivalent to `\.pdf$` without carrying a backslash through the resolved seam's
replacement-string splice. `{{CMS_CURRENT_HOST}}` survives both render paths
inside labels and hints, then `site-hostname.js` replaces it with the
publishing destination (the host of the served config's `site_url`: the
canonical host on production from any access host, the preview host on a
preview, #533; see `theme/admin/README.md`) only inside Decap's own
`FieldLabel` and `ControlHint` nodes.
Authored content is outside that narrow mutation surface.

## Form-control ownership (Decap 3.15.1 source audit)

The three platform admin shells load Decap 3.15.1. Its
[published source map](https://unpkg.com/decap-cms@3.15.1/dist/decap-cms.js.map)
establishes these upstream owners:

- [`decap-cms-core/dist/esm/components/Editor/EditorControlPane/EditorControl.js`](https://unpkg.com/decap-cms@3.15.1/dist/decap-cms.js.map)
  generates the field ID and label's `htmlFor`; adjacent
  [`Widget.js`](https://unpkg.com/decap-cms@3.15.1/dist/decap-cms.js.map) passes
  `forID` to the widget.
- The posts `body` field uses `markdown` in
  [`theme/admin/config.base.yml`](../theme/admin/config.base.yml).
  [`decap-cms-widget-markdown/dist/esm/MarkdownControl/index.js`](https://unpkg.com/decap-cms@3.15.1/dist/decap-cms.js.map) renders
  `div.cms-editor-visual` without forwarding `forID`; its
  [`VisualEditor.js`](https://unpkg.com/decap-cms@3.15.1/dist/decap-cms.js.map)
  renders Slate's `Editable` without an ID or `aria-labelledby`. This explains
  the selected body label's missing target.
- [`node_modules/react-textarea-autosize/dist/react-textarea-autosize.browser.esm.js`](https://unpkg.com/decap-cms@3.15.1/dist/decap-cms.js.map)
  appends a hidden measurement textarea to `document.body`, with
  `tabindex="-1"` and `aria-hidden="true"`. It is a sizing helper, not an
  editor field.

This source audit does not reconstruct the owner's reported ten unmatched
labels or five anonymous textareas. The other nine label mappings and exact
helper count require the original DOM snapshot. Keep upstream fixes upstream;
do not patch the vendored bundle or add a generic label-repair observer.

The platform owns the rejection textarea in
[`theme/admin/reviews/index.html`](../theme/admin/reviews/index.html):
its visible label targets a unique per-run ID, it has `name="comment"`, and
only positive safe-integer run IDs enter the markup. The existing
[`e2e/reviews-dashboard-lint.test.js`](../e2e/reviews-dashboard-lint.test.js)
checks two simultaneous cards and malformed
IDs offline. The posts-list fixture checkbox in
[`theme/admin/posts-list-enhance.js`](../theme/admin/posts-list-enhance.js)
already has a native enclosing label.

## Draft media fallback: an unpublished upload still renders

`public_folder: /assets/images/uploads` is absolute, and Decap's
`isAbsolutePath` (`/^(?:[a-z]+:)?\/\/|^\//i`) hands an absolute value back
untouched, so right after an upload Decap renders
`<img src="/assets/images/uploads/<name>">` against the admin's own origin
instead of the draft blob it holds. Production does not have the file until the
post publishes: the Featured Image thumbnail, the preview pane and Live Preview
(`/preview/`, which renders the raw field and marked's raw body srcs) all showed
a broken image, while the preview-pr host, which serves the branch, did not.
The flat absolute path stays: it is the content contract above
`public_folder` in `config.base.yml`, locked by `e2e/cms-config.spec.js`.

`theme/admin/draft-media-fallback.js` repairs the image after it fails, never
before, so a published image costs nothing:

- **Detection.** A capture-phase `error` listener on `document`, and on each
  same-origin iframe's document (Decap's preview pane), attached from a
  capture-phase `load` listener. There is no DOM-walking MutationObserver (the
  Safari postmortem in `preview-bridge.js`). Only a same-origin `<img>` directly
  under the served config's `public_folder` is touched, once per original src
  (`data-draft-media-fallback`).
- **Source 1: the File this tab uploaded.** The script loads non-deferred
  before `decap-cms.js` in `index.html` and `index-local.html` and wraps
  `URL.createObjectURL`, which Decap's `AssetProxy` calls for every upload. A
  File matches when Decap's upload-name transform (`persistMedia`:
  `sanitizeSlug(file.name.toLowerCase(), config.slug)`, mirrored by
  `normalizeUploadName`) equals the image's basename. This covers an entry that
  was never saved.
- **Source 2: the entry's editorial branch.** `GET
  /repos/<repo>/contents/<media_folder>/<name>?ref=cms/<collection>/<slug>`
  (Decap's `branchFromContentKey`), `Accept: application/vnd.github.raw`, with
  the token Decap stores in `localStorage["decap-cms-user"]`; on a 404, the
  config's `backend.branch`. Collection and slug come from the editor route,
  or on `/preview/` from the bridge, whose payload now carries `slug` (re-sent
  once when a new entry's route gains it, because a new entry's `postSave`
  carries an empty slug). Skipped for `local_backend` and non-GitHub configs.
  The admin CSP already allows `connect-src https://api.github.com` and
  `img-src blob:`; `connect-src blob:` covers Decap's fetch of an uploaded image (#627).

Residual gap: with `slug.clean_accents: true` the name match strips accents with
Unicode NFD, where Decap uses the `diacritics` map, so letters NFD does not
decompose (ø, ß, ł) miss source 1 and fall through to source 2. Unit tests:
`e2e/draft-media-fallback.test.js` and `e2e/preview-bridge-payload.test.js`;
live: the pre-Save step in `e2e/cms-media-roundtrip.spec.js`. The other half of
the incident, a cached 404 outliving the publish, is in `docs/OPERATIONS.md`
§ "The production 404 page is never cacheable".

## Media library tidy (#736): upload names, `.gitkeep`, and the image a deleted entry leaves

Three rough edges in Decap's media library, all in Decap core with no config
lever (decap-cms 3.15.1). Two are fixed by `theme/admin/media-library-tidy.js`
(non-deferred, before `decap-cms.js`, in `index.html` and `index-local.html`;
not in the stock-Decap rehearsal shell `index-test.html`); the third is a
decision, recorded here.

- **Trailing hyphen in an upload's name.** `Workshop Diagram (final).jpg` was
  stored as `workshop-diagram-final-.jpg`. `persistMedia` names the file
  `sanitizeSlug(file.name.toLowerCase(), config.slug)`; sanitizeSlug trims a
  leading or trailing replacement off the WHOLE string, which still ends in
  `.jpg`, so the `-` that `)` became is never seen. No `slug:` option helps
  (`sanitize_replacement: ""` also deletes the hyphens between words, and the
  options also name every post file). The shim trims leading and trailing
  non-letter/mark/digit characters off the part of the name before its last
  dot, on the File itself, in capture-phase `change` and `drop` listeners that
  run before Decap's `handlePersist`. It renames the File in place (an own
  `name` property), so `draft-media-fallback.js`, which matches uploads by File
  and Decap's name transform, sees the stored name. Existing files are not
  renamed.
- **`.gitkeep` as a tile.** Decap lists every blob in the media folder. The
  library is a virtualized grid, so hiding the tile in the DOM would leave a
  blank cell; the shim instead filters the listing in a `window.fetch` wrap: the
  GitHub `git/trees/<ref>:<dir>` answer (production) and decap-server's
  `getMedia` answer (`index-local.html`). Dotfiles are dropped; everything else
  passes through with the caller's own arguments.
- **A deleted entry's image stays in Media. Not fixed, on purpose.** An upload
  is not owned by an entry: the same file can be a featured image on two posts,
  an inline body image, a site hero or a Site Settings value, and Decap keeps no
  reference index. Deleting "the entry's images" with the entry would break any
  other page that uses one, with no undo short of a git revert. So there is no
  automatic delete. What the issue proposed as safe options are both feature
  work for the owner to schedule: a delete-time prompt that lists only images
  no other entry or data file references (needs a scan of every collection's
  content, not just the one entry), or an "unused" flag in the library built
  from the same scan. Until then an orphan costs repository bytes and a tile,
  and is removed by hand from the Media library (or by a PR). The delete-success
  toast is #649.

Tests: `e2e/media-library-tidy.test.js` (name trim through Decap's transform,
listing filters, the fetch wrap's pass-through, load order). The browser
behavior of the two listeners was also checked in Chromium (real `<input
type=file>` change and a synthetic drop); Firefox and WebKit were not.

## The /admin logo is SITE-owned; the gem ships a neutral placeholder (#25)

The rule (issue #25): the /admin logo is SITE-OWNED and the gem ships only a
NEUTRAL placeholder. `theme/assets/images/logo.svg` is a wordless, brand-free
generic glyph — NEVER a specific site's mark (no "AD"/initials/wordmark). The
render hooks default `cms.logo_url` to `<url>/assets/images/logo.svg`, and a site
brands `/admin` by **shadowing** that gem asset with its own
`assets/images/logo.svg` (Jekyll site files win over same-path gem files) or by
setting `cms.logo_url`. The scaffolder seeds a "replace me" copy into every new
site. Locked by `theme/spec/neutral_logo_test.rb` (gem asset is wordless +
carries the override comment) and `e2e/scaffold-seeds-neutral-logo.test.js`
(scaffold output). Don't reintroduce a brand into the gem asset.

## Site favicon (gem-shipped, brand-free — issue #325)

The gem ships zero favicon references (no `<link rel="icon">` anywhere in
`theme/_layouts/`, no icon asset), so every consumer page carries no
declared icon and the browser falls back to an automatic same-origin
`GET /favicon.ico` — which 404s, on both consumers, on every page view.

**Same shadowing pattern as the `/admin` logo above**, applied to a page-level
asset instead of an admin-only one:

- **The gem ships a neutral, brand-free favicon**: `theme/assets/favicon.svg`
  — wordless, no initials/wordmark, carrying an override comment (mirrors
  `theme/assets/images/logo.svg`; locked by `theme/spec/neutral_favicon_test.rb`
  the same way `neutral_logo_test.rb` locks the logo).
- **A gem-owned, standalone include emits the `<link>` tag**:
  `theme/_includes/favicon.html`. It reads only `site.cms.favicon_url` (falls
  back to `<baseurl>/assets/favicon.svg` via `relative_url`, honoring an
  explicit override verbatim — same own-value-wins semantics as `cms.logo_url`
  in `decap_config_hook.rb`) and `site.baseurl`. Because it depends on nothing
  else `default.html` provides, it also works from a **site-owned layout with
  its own `<head>`** — just add:

  ```liquid
  {% include favicon.html %}
  ```

  inside that layout's `<head>`. This is the piece a single-page,
  custom-design consumer (jodidaniel.com's `home.html`) needs, since its
  layout never extends the gem's `default.html`.
- **`theme/_layouts/default.html`'s `<head>` includes it once**, which is
  sufficient coverage for every gem layout: `post.html`, `page.html`,
  `project.html`, `tag.html`, `canary.html`, and `preview.html` all declare
  `layout: default` in their own front matter, so they inherit it —
  `e2e/scaffold-seeds-favicon.test.js` asserts this is actually true (parses
  every non-`default.html` layout's front matter) rather than assuming it.
- **A site brands it by shadowing `assets/favicon.svg`** (Jekyll site files
  win over same-path gem files) or by setting `cms.favicon_url`. The
  scaffolder seeds a "replace me" copy at `assets/favicon.svg`, byte-derived
  from the gem asset so the two can't drift (`seedFavicon()` in
  `scaffold/create-site.js`, mirroring `seedLogo()`).
- **Fallback strategy, deliberately SVG-only**: once the `<link rel="icon">`
  tag is present, on-spec browsers stop the automatic `/favicon.ico` probe
  that was 404ing (that request only fires when the page declares no icon at
  all) — so the SVG-only asset already closes the reported gap for every
  currently-supported browser (Chromium/Firefox since ~2021, Safari 16.4+).
  We do NOT also ship an `.ico`/`.png` fallback, for the same reason the logo
  placeholder is SVG-only: it would be the only raster asset type the gem
  ships. A site that needs pre-2021-browser or platform-icon (e.g.
  `apple-touch-icon`) support can add those tags itself alongside the include.

**Locked by**: `theme/spec/neutral_favicon_test.rb` (gem asset is wordless,
square viewBox, carries the override comment) and
`e2e/scaffold-seeds-favicon.test.js` (scaffold output + neutrality + the
actual `<head>` emission — both the include's own content and its real
presence in `default.html`'s `<head>`, not just documented intent). Existing
consumers (adamdaniel.ai, jodidaniel.com) will not retroactively pick this
up — a `platform_ref` bump gets them the gem's `favicon.html` include and
`assets/favicon.svg` default automatically (nothing to change on their end for
the default to work), but the fix for jodidaniel.com's own `<head>`
(`_layouts/home.html`) is the one-line `{% include favicon.html %}` add above,
made in that repo.

## The scaffolder seeds `preview.md` + `404.html` (issue #23)

The scaffolder seeds both files, and it has to (issue #23). A consuming
site MUST expose `/preview/` (the admin "Live Preview" target) and a graceful
`404.html`, or the admin button dead-ends on a raw S3 404 and unknown URLs 404
ungracefully. The gem ships `theme/_layouts/preview.html` (the preview SHELL,
with the hidden post/page/project variants the admin `preview-bridge` streams
into) + the admin scripts, but the consuming site must provide the `/preview/`
PAGE. `scaffold/create-site.js` seeds both (`SEED_PREVIEW` / `SEED_404`):
`preview.md` is **front-matter only** (`layout: preview`, `permalink: /preview/`,
`sitemap: false`) and carries **no front-matter `robots`** — the gem preview
layout HARDCODES `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">`, so a
front-matter one would duplicate it (mirrors `adamdaniel.ai/preview.md`).
`404.html` rides the gem `default` layout (which DOES render `page.robots`), so
it carries `robots: "noindex,nofollow"` + `sitemap: false` + a home/blog link;
copy is generic (no site identity). The `e2e/fixture-site` carries both (it
represents a scaffolded site) and the platform lint
`e2e/scaffold-preview-and-404.test.js` asserts the contract: (a) scaffold
output, (b) fixture parity, (c) optional post-build proof that
`_site/preview/index.html` renders the `data-preview-root` shell +
`_site/404.html` exists (skips when no Jekyll toolchain — pure-fs self-CI
lanes). **Single-page-site caveat:** per-item *live* preview is limited for a
single-page bio (jodidaniel.com — no per-section route to drive the bridge);
the seeded `preview.md` still gives a working `/preview/` shell + the seeded
`404.html` a friendly not-found page.

## The admin host's own not-found page (#517)

`theme/admin/not-found.html` is not the site's 404. It is what a site that
serves its editor from its own origin (`AdminDomainName`, see
`docs/ADMIN-AUTH-SECURITY.md`) answers every miss on that host with, so it
shares an origin with the editor's tokens: plain HTML, no script, no style, no
external resource, no layout or include, and no `window.CMS_*` injection (the
render paths only touch `index*.html` and `reviews/*.html`).
`theme/spec/admin_not_found_page_test.rb` parses it against an allowlist.

## Seeded 404 page: self-contained and neutral, not gem-styled (issue #326)

`404.html` is, and always was, **site-owned** — the scaffolder seeds it
(`SEED_404` in `scaffold/create-site.js`), but a consuming site's own repo
commits and can freely edit its own copy. What changed in #326 is the LOOK the
*seed* ships with.

**The problem the redesign fixes**: the old seed carried `layout: default`, so
its look came from the gem's `default` layout + `assets/css/main.css` — the
"Cobalt Thermal" dark, monospace-accented design that IS adamdaniel.ai's whole
site. That's invisible on adamdaniel.ai (it's the same look everywhere) and
jarring on a consumer with its own design system (jodidaniel.com's light
blue-gradient, Raleway/Source-Sans bio) whose 404 page was the ONLY gem-styled
surface left in a visitor's path — two independent testers flagged it
unprompted as reading like a different project. This is a **platform pattern
problem**: every future design-custom consumer inherits the same brand break
from the seed, not just this one site.

**The fix**: the seeded `404.html` now carries **no `layout:` field at all**.
It is its own complete, self-contained `<!DOCTYPE html>` document — no
dependence on `default.html`, no `{% include header.html %}` /
`{% include footer.html %}`, no `assets/css/main.css` — with its own minimal,
neutral, system-font inline `<style>`. Brandability is a SMALL, explicit
surface: a `:root { --nf-bg; --nf-fg; --nf-muted; --nf-accent; --nf-font; }`
block at the top of that `<style>` a site can retune (in its own committed
copy — there's no gem asset to shadow here, since 404.html was never
gem-owned) without needing to redesign the whole page. The defaults are
neutral enough to sit acceptably next to either the gem's own look or a fully
custom one.

**LOCKED regardless of any future restyle** (`e2e/scaffold-preview-and-404.test.js`
enforces every one of these):

- `permalink: /404.html` (the correct-HTTP-404 contract — unchanged),
- `robots: "noindex,nofollow"` + `sitemap: false` — and since no layout
  renders `page.robots` for this page anymore, it emits its own
  `<meta name="robots" content="{{ page.robots }}">` directly,
- a working link home (`{{ '/' | relative_url }}`),
- generic, site-agnostic copy (no site identity baked into the seed).

The lint also now asserts the *shape* of the redesign itself, not just the
locked bits: the seed has NO `layout:` field (self-contained), is a full
`<!DOCTYPE html>…</html>` document, does not reference
`assets/css/main.css` or the gem header/footer includes, and exposes at least
a few `--*` CSS custom properties. `e2e/fixture-site/404.html` is kept
byte-identical to the scaffolder's own output (assertion (b) in that spec).

As a byproduct, the redesign also dropped a dead "browse the blog" link the
old seed carried unconditionally — a single-page-bio consumer with no `_posts/`
had a 404 page linking to a blog index that itself 404s (the same class of bug
`header.html`'s conditional Blog nav link exists to avoid — see the comment
there).

**Existing consumers do not retroactively pick this up.** `404.html` is
site-owned and already committed in both adamdaniel.ai and jodidaniel.com; a
`platform_ref` bump changes nothing about it, because the scaffolder only runs
once, at site creation. A site that wants the new neutral shape has to copy
the new `SEED_404` template (or hand-author an equivalent) into its own
`404.html` itself. For jodidaniel.com specifically, this is a low-risk,
high-value adopt: replace its `404.html` body with the new self-contained
template (adjusting `--nf-*` to its own palette if desired) in a normal PR —
nothing else in the seeding contract changes, and the render-neutral check in
"Approving `regression-review` on a render-neutral PR" above does not apply
here (`404.html` is not under `theme/`, so that specific gate is irrelevant;
the PR will still go through the ordinary visual-regression lane like any
other content change).
