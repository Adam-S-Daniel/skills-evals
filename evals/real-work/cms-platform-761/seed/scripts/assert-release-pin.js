/*
 * Refuse a consumer's platform pin that is a PRERELEASE.
 *
 * `release.yml` can cut `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` as a GitHub prerelease so a platform fix
 * can be validated on ONE consumer PR before it reaches production. That is
 * deliberately pinnable: a stacked branch sets `platform_ref: v0.1.89-rc.1` and
 * its preview builds against the RC. What must NOT happen is that pin riding
 * into the consumer's DEFAULT branch, where it becomes what production builds
 * and deploys from — an RC is a validation tag, not a release.
 *
 * Nothing stopped that before. `platform-bump` can't introduce one (it resolves
 * `releases/latest`, which excludes prereleases), but a hand-pinned validation
 * branch is exactly how an RC gets into a repo in the first place, and merging
 * that branch was a single click away from shipping it.
 *
 * SCOPE is the caller's, not this script's. This reads one key and answers one
 * question. The thin caller's `on: pull_request: branches:` decides WHICH
 * merges are guarded — the canonical caller targets the default branch, so an
 * RC stays pinnable everywhere else. Same division of labour as
 * platform-pin-consistency.yml.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT in scope: a `platform_ref` that is a sha or a branch name.
 * Those are also not releases, but they are not what this guard was asked for,
 * and failing them would change the failure mode for setups nobody has audited.
 * `check-platform-pin-consistency.js` already forces every OTHER reference to
 * agree with whatever `platform.lock` says.
 *
 *   node scripts/assert-release-pin.js [--root DIR] [--lock REL]
 *
 * Exit codes are three-valued ON PURPOSE, so a caller can tell "ran, found a
 * prerelease" apart from "could not run" — a guard that cannot read its input
 * must never look like a pass:
 *   0  ran, the pin is not a prerelease
 *   1  ran, the pin IS a prerelease (printed)
 *   2  could not run (no platform.lock, unparseable, no platform_ref)
