// Classify each write in a repo-settings fix plan as SAFE (cannot reduce
// protection) or GATED (might, or is not understood well enough to say).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `repo-settings-apply.yml` puts every apply behind a human
// reviewer. That was the right default and it decayed exactly the way a
// blanket gate always does: the daily re-converge asked for an approval every
// morning, the approvals it asked for were routine tightenings a human had
// already merged into `repo-settings.yml`, and — because the request was
// indistinguishable from a request that mattered — the one item that actually
// needed a look (adamdaniel.ai's `main` ruleset losing
// `prerelease-guard / prerelease-guard`, #310) sat unapplied from 2026-08-27
// while four consecutive runs asked about it. A gate a person clicks daily is
// not a control; it is a habit, and habits do not read the diff.
//
// So the gate is narrowed to the writes where a human's judgement can change
// the outcome: anything that could REDUCE protection on a repository. A write
// that can only add protection is applied unattended.
//
// TWO PROPERTIES MAKE THAT SAFE, AND BOTH ARE LOAD-BEARING:
//
//  1. FAIL CLOSED, ALWAYS. This is an ALLOWLIST, not a denylist. A write is
//     SAFE only if it matches a shape enumerated below; every unrecognised
//     key, rule type, parameter or value — including one GitHub adds next
//     year — is GATED. The cost of a false GATED is one click. The cost of a
//     false SAFE is an unattended admin write that weakened a repo. Those are
//     not symmetric, and this file is written as though only the second one
//     exists.
//
//  2. IT IS ENFORCED AT WRITE TIME, NOT AT ROUTING TIME. The workflow uses
//     this classification to decide which job runs, but the ungated job also
//     passes `--refuse-weakening`, which re-runs the classifier against the
//     plan it is about to apply and refuses the whole plan if anything is
//     GATED. So a bug in a workflow `if:` cannot produce an unattended
//     weakening write — it can only produce a red job. Same shape as the
//     read/write token split in repo-settings-apply.yml's header note 2:
//     incapable, rather than trusted.
//
// A NOTE ON "TIGHTENING" AS A WORD. Nothing here reasons about whether a
// setting is *good*. It reasons about one question only: can applying this
// write leave the repository with FEWER constraints than it has now? Removing
// a required status check can. Adding one cannot. Disabling a merge method
// cannot. Enabling one can. Where the answer is "it depends", the answer is
// GATED.
