# Copy each OPTED-IN archived PDF out of the private media archive into the
# built site, so the deploy publishes it.
#
# The archive is a private S3 bucket: a site's `_media/*.md` entries name an
# object in it (`pdf_archive_file`) but the bytes never live in the site repo,
# which is public. `pdf_public` is the editor's permission gate — off by
# default. This script is the ONLY thing that moves an object from the private
# archive onto the public web, and it moves exactly the ones whose gate is
# open. An entry with a key and `pdf_public: false` is not copied, so the file
# is not merely unlinked on the site, it is not there at all.
#
#   bash scripts/publish-opted-in-pdfs.sh [SITE_DIR]
#
# SITE_DIR defaults to `_site`. Configured by environment:
#   MEDIA_ARCHIVE_BUCKET   private bucket holding the PDFs (REQUIRED to do work)
#   MEDIA_ARCHIVE_PREFIX   key prefix inside it            (default: media-pdfs)
#   MEDIA_COLLECTION_DIR   where the entries live          (default: _media)
#   MEDIA_PUBLIC_DIR       path under SITE_DIR to write to (default: media-pdfs)
#
# Fail-soft vs fail-loud, deliberately split (see docs/MEDIA-ARCHIVE.md):
#   - No bucket configured  -> notice naming the exact knob, exit 0. A site that
#     has not adopted the archive must deploy normally.
#   - Bucket configured but an opted-in object is missing or unreadable -> exit
#     1. The page renders a "Download PDF" button for that entry, so shipping
#     without the file is a confident 404 in front of a visitor.

# Parse the front matter with a REAL YAML parser, never a line scan (AGENTS.md).
# A regex cannot tell `pdf_public: true` apart from the same text inside a
# quoted string or a comment (a fixture whose TITLE contains that phrase proved
# it), and it reads an aliased or merge-keyed value wrong.
#
# Two things about how this is invoked are load-bearing:
#
#   * The ruby body is ASCII-ONLY. `ruby -e` parses its argument as US-ASCII, so
#     a single en dash in a message is `invalid multibyte char` -- a compile
#     error, not a warning.
#   * The status is CHECKED. `mapfile -t KEYS < <(ruby ...)` reads the exit code
#     of `mapfile`, never ruby's, so a ruby that died on line 1 produced an empty
#     key list and this script cheerfully reported "nothing to publish" and
#     exited 0. That is the masked-exit-code trap in AGENTS.md, and here it fails
#     OPEN: a broken parser silently unpublishes every opted-in PDF. Route
#     through a file so the failure is a failure.
