"""Shared check that a workflow's `uses:` pin goes through actions.lock.

Third-party actions are named by release tag, and
`.github/workflows/actions.lock` locks each tag to an exact commit (ADR 0024
in Adam-S-Daniel/_agent-guidance). A local step `uses:` (`./`, `$/`) needs
no lock. A `docker://` ref is not in the lockfile, so it must be pinned by
digest (`@sha256:<64 lowercase hex>`). An `Adam-S-Daniel/cms-platform/` ref
must name an exact release tag (`@vX.Y.Z`). Any other `uses:`
must have a lockfile entry keyed by the exact `uses:` string,
whose `commit` is `sha1-<40 lowercase hex>`, whose `ref` is the text after the
last `@`, and which the lockfile's `workflows` list for that file names.

The lockfile is read with PyYAML, never a line scan.
