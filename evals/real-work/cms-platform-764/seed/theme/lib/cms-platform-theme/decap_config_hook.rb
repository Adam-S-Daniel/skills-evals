# Renders the live Decap admin config from the site's _config.yml at the end of
# every build, so a site never hand-authors the ~400-line config. Mirrors
# scripts/render-decap-config.rb but reads site.config directly.
#
# As of v0.1.4 the admin/ machinery (base configs + the JS/HTML shells +
# reviews dashboards) ships INSIDE this gem (theme/admin), so a consuming site
# no longer vendors byte-copies. This hook therefore:
#   - resolves the machinery INPUTS from the gem (site.theme.root/admin),
#     falling back to a vendored site/admin for backward-compat during the
#     migration window (and for the platform's own e2e fixture);
#   - COPIES the gem-resident machinery into _site/admin (Jekyll won't, since
#     the site tree no longer contains admin/); and
#   - still reads the SITE-OWNED seam (admin/collections.site.yml) from the
#     site source, never the gem.
# No-op for sites with neither a gem-shipped nor a vendored admin/config.base.yml.
