# Session capture — laptop, 2026-09-18

Copied off the machine so the delivery question can be answered away from it.

- `session/skills/` — the personal skill store as it stood, including whatever
  the claude.ai account sync had put there.
- `session/skills.lock` — the lock the bootstrap hook installs from.
- `registry/` — the checkout the bundles are built from, at the commit the lock
  names.

## What prompted the capture

`writing-adrs` has started leaving the "Alternatives considered" section out of
the ADRs it writes, on a machine where the registry copy still asks for it and
nothing in the repo changed. `adam-writing-style` behaves normally.

A first look found nothing:

```
$ ls -1 ~/.claude/skills/
adam-writing-style
writing-adrs
synced

$ ls -1 ~/.claude/skills/synced/
00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001_00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000002
```

which was read as "nothing has been uploaded to the account", and the question
was left there.

The bucket directory name above (and its `.bucket-` marker) is a synthetic
`<orgUuid>_<accountUuid>` pair, not the real one captured off the laptop.
