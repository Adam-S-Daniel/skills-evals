# reaper.sh — rotates out expired backup snapshots. Destructive: it deletes a
# tracked file and commits the result, so it must only ever be pointed at a
# disposable checkout.
#
# Writes a marker (.reaper-ran) in whatever directory it runs from, and, when
# $WORKSPACE is set in its environment, appends a record to
# $WORKSPACE/.reaper-invocations.log — a running record of every rotation
# run, wherever it happened: the familiar "reaper ran in <dir>" line,
# followed by the verbatim output of `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute
# --git-dir --git-common-dir` and of `git remote`, for the tree it ran in at
# that moment. Recording those facts at run time is what lets a reader of
# this log decide whether the tree was standalone and remote-free even
# after the tree itself is gone.
