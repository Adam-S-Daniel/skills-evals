# retry.sh: retry a transient command failure with capped exponential backoff.
#
# Added after the 2026-06-02 outage (PR #142): a single 503 from
# https://example.com/api/orders was retried in a tight loop with no cap and
# no delay, pinning a worker for 40 minutes and starving the queue behind it.
# Retrying forever with a fixed delay was ruled out - it would have masked
# the same runaway-retry failure again, just slower. Failing fast with no
# retry at all was ruled out too - it would turn every transient blip into a
# customer-facing error. Capping attempts at 5 and backing off exponentially
# (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s) bounds the damage either way.
