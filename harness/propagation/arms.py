"""Tier-2 propagation arms: one per delivery channel, each with a control leg.

Every arm runs the SAME probe twice against identically-materialised scratch
state — once before the channel delivers anything (the control leg), once
after — and asserts on the DIFFERENCE. Nothing here ever asserts equality over
`init.skills` as a whole: the CLI's built-in skill set is not stable across
versions or even across runs (measured: a `schedule` entry present in one run
and absent in the next), so a whole-set assertion would go red for reasons that
have nothing to do with propagation, and would then get muted.

Anti-vacuity is structural, not a convention:

* **The differential.** `delivered = counts(arm) - counts(control)`, compared
  for EXACT SET EQUALITY against what the lock says the channel owes. An arm
  that merely counted "more skills than before" would pass on any plugin.
* **Guards.** Every leg records a guard block — HOME isolation, env allowlist,
  the bootstrap surface variables this leg intends to carry, account-store
  absence, a non-empty built-in floor, the init event's index, unparseable line
  count. Any guard not OK makes the
  arm INCONCLUSIVE (exit 2), never PASS and never FAIL. The arm that expects
  to find NOTHING is the one most able to pass on a dead CLI, so it is the one
  that most needs a floor.
* **Negative controls with a structural expectation.** The bootstrap hook's
  control leg does not merely assert "the skills are not visible" — that also
  holds if the hook crashed, if the lock were missing, or if the clone 404'd.
  It asserts the `skipped — durable session…, marketplace install is
  authoritative` shape (an interpolated diagnostic clause in the middle is
  allowed — see `HOOK_SKIPPED_RE`) AND an empty `$HOME/.claude/skills`.
