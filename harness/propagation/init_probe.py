"""The propagation primitive: read a session's loaded skill set, credential-free.

`claude -p … --output-format stream-json --verbose` emits a
`{"type":"system","subtype":"init"}` event carrying `skills`, `plugins`,
`slash_commands` and the CLI version. That event is produced entirely locally,
BEFORE the first API call — measured on CLI 2.1.231 with
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9`, `init.apiKeySource == "none"` and the
`api_retry` events only appear after it. So the whole assertion layer costs
$0.00, needs no credential and no network, and can therefore run on every pull
request instead of behind `eval.yml`'s OIDC.

Three measured traps this module exists to close:

1. **The init event's position is NOT contractual.** Measured on the same CLI
   build: index 0 under a scrubbed `env -i` environment, index 4 under the
   ambient one (behind `active_goal`, `autocompact_state` and two
   `commands_changed` events). Select on `(type, subtype)`, never an index,
   never a regex over the stream. Selecting on `type == "system"` alone picks
   `commands_changed`, which has no `skills` key at all.

2. **A scratch `HOME` is necessary but NOT sufficient.** Same scratch HOME, two
   runs: with `env -i PATH HOME TMPDIR` the session loaded 16 skills and wrote
   nothing account-shaped; inheriting the ambient environment it loaded 35 — 17
   account-store skills re-synced in, and `$HOME/.claude/skills/synced/` created
   under the scratch dir. Unsetting `CLAUDE_CODE_SYNC_SKILLS` alone does not
   stop it. Hence PASSTHROUGH: an env ALLOWLIST, built up from nothing. Never
   `{**os.environ, ...}`.

3. **A probe launched from inside a Claude Code session inherits
   `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE_SESSION_ID` / `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=remote`**, which
   are exactly what agentskills' `skills-bootstrap.sh` surface guard keys on. A
   bootstrap-hook control leg that inherits them installs the skills it was
   supposed to decline to install, and the "expect invisible" assertion then
   passes for entirely the wrong reason. The allowlist scrubs them.

`--disallowedTools …,Skill` does NOT suppress the init event's skill list
(measured: same names with and without; only `tools` loses `"Skill"`), so an
init-event probe can disallow every tool and stay fully sighted. That is a real
difference from a BEHAVIOURAL probe like `run_canary.py`, where tool controls
are load-bearing. Scope flags are still refused by default here (see `probe`)
because `--setting-sources project` DOES change the answer — it drops
user-level skills — and an arm that acquires one by accident measures a
different surface than the one it names.
