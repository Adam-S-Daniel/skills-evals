"""Run a skill eval fixture.

Usage:
    python3 harness/run_eval.py evals/<skill> --arm objective-only
    python3 harness/run_eval.py evals/<skill> --arm both [--registry NAME=PATH ...] [--no-judge]

`--arm objective-only` scores a workspace as-is (no agent invocation) — the
pristine seed should FAIL the fixture's checks; a correctly reworked copy
should PASS. `--arm with_skill|without_skill|both` runs the agent under test
(the Claude Code CLI, headless) on a fresh copy of the seed, scores it with
the objective checks and the LLM judge, and writes a summary + report under
`--results-dir` (default `results/`).

    replacement characters — unreadable, and mostly useless, judge input.
    Deciding by UTF-8-decodability instead targets the actual failure mode
