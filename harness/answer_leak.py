"""The answer-leak lint for real-work fixtures, and `interface_strings:`.

A real-work fixture's task text is the issue its pull request closed. Some of
those issues were edited after the fix and describe or quote it, so the task
text must not carry any run of four or more consecutive words that also
appears in a line the merged diff added (the same four-word rule #98 applies
to a guidance section). Words are lowercase letter and digit runs: the rule is
lexical, so a regex is the right tool here.

A hidden test sometimes checks an exact identifier or message (a status name,
an exported function, an `::error::` text). The task text has to name it, or
no fix can pass however correct. Each fixture declares those strings in
`interface_strings:` (Adam, 2026-10-06: "Exempt interface strings"), and a
four-word run made only of one declared string's own consecutive words is
not a leak.

The diff often quotes the issue rather than the reverse: a fix's comments,
test data and ADR prose restate the issue's evidence. So text the issue
already held before the pull request's first commit is not a leak either
(Adam, 2026-10-06: "Exempt pre-existing issue text"). A fixture records that
text in the file `issue_before_fix:` names, and the lint flags only runs the
task text shares with the diff that the snapshot lacks: the task text's own
additions, such as an interface paragraph, and any issue text written after
the fix began. How a snapshot is established, and its limits, is in DESIGN.md.
