"""Tier-2 propagation probes: does each delivery channel still deliver?

One arm per channel, each spawning the real Claude Code CLI twice (control leg,
then arm leg) and asserting on the difference against `skills.lock`. Unlike
`run_eval.py` and `run_canary.py` this runner reaches NO API and needs NO
credential: it reads the `system/init` event, which the CLI computes locally
before its first request, then kills the child. A full five-arm run costs
$0.00, so this belongs on `pull_request` rather than behind `eval.yml`'s OIDC —
where a branch dispatch would die at token exchange and tell you nothing.

(The Tier-3 account audit and the freshness gate that relayed it were retired
2026-09-28: every surface now takes skills from repo-based marketplace plugins,
so there is no account store of our own to audit. The probe-leg isolation
guards against the account channel that still delivers Anthropic's own skills
stay in `propagation/init_probe.py` and `propagation/arms.py`.)

Usage:
    python3 harness/run_propagation.py evals/propagation
    python3 harness/run_propagation.py evals/propagation --arm bootstrap-hook
    python3 harness/run_propagation.py evals/propagation --self-test

Exit codes: 0 everything asserted holds; 1 an assertion failed; 2 a probe
fault — the CLI would not start, the stream changed shape, or a guard did not
hold, so neither a pass nor a fail would have meant anything.

    rather than harness/registries.yml's multi-registry NAME=PATH scheme —
    the two are deliberately NOT the same shape any more; don't assume parity.

    ABSOLUTE on every branch, and that is load-bearing rather than tidiness:
    the arms hand registry-derived paths to children they spawn with `cwd` set
    to a scratch workspace — `arms._run_hook` runs `bash <hook>` there — so a
    relative registry is read against a directory that does not contain it.

    `--registry ../agentskills`: both hook-running arms died with rc=127,
