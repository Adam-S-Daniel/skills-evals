"""The skill retirement verdict (#70, part 1): cells, their classes, and the
verdict over them. Thresholds live in `evals/gate-policy.yml`.

Guidance sections (#124) get the same verdict over their ablation pair
(`guidance_verdict`, at the end of this module): the rules below apply with
"skill" read as "section".

POOLED EVIDENCE (Adam, 2026-10-25), replacing #70's four weekly sweeps.

  * A CELL is (skill, fixture, current roster arm model), for every fixture
    of the skill ON MAIN (scripts/compute_gates.py enumerates them from the
    evals directory) and every arm model of the roster it is given
    (`--roster`). A cell with no run is `missing`; runs of a fixture no
    longer on main, or of a model no longer on the roster, are not read: the
    roster follows current use (Adam, 2026-10-25), so a superseded model
    leaves at once and no evidence is asked of it. A fixture moved to a
    new name with its content unchanged keeps its runs (`FIXTURE_ALIASES`,
    digest-checked by `pooled_fixture`). The arm
    model is the REQUESTED one: `cross_model.model`, which
    harness/run_eval.py writes from the arm's own `--model`
    (`_write_summary`'s `agent_model`) and `run_eval._arm_model` reads back;
    never `models_used`, which includes subagent models.
  * THE UNIT IS THE RUN. Trials within one run are near-identical, so each
    arm of each run is reduced to its mean trial pass rate (and mean judge
    figure), and every interval is over those run means. A run counts for an
    arm only with at least `MIN_TRIALS_PER_RUN` (1, round 5: the weekly
    sweep fires one trial per run) scored trials in that arm.
  * THE ARMS ARE TWO INDEPENDENT SAMPLES of ONE comparison, pooled
    (`pool_cells`, the one function that decides which runs a cell holds)
    against the content ON MAIN, never the newest run's:
      - with arm: the skill's `tested_digest` as the registry checkout gives
        it and the fixture's `fixture_digest` as the evals directory gives it
        (both computed by compute_gates with the functions run_eval uses);
      - without arm: the same fixture digest. It does not hold the subject,
        so it pools across `tested_digest` changes.
    Their arm contexts (`arm_context.skills_digest` and `guidance_digest`)
    are chosen JOINTLY (`_joint_context`, round 5, B6): only a with group
    and a without group sharing a pair key, the same non-subject skills
    (`arm_context.others_digest`) and frozen guidance
    (`context.guidance.digest`), can form the cell, and of those pairs the
    one with the most runs in its smaller arm, on roster models, is chosen;
    a tie, or no such pair, chooses none and the cell is `insufficient`. So
    a without arm from older guidance cannot be pooled against a with arm
    from newer guidance. The arm context cannot be computed from main (it
    is the frozen context a run deployed), so the pair with the most runs
    chooses it, and an honest context change counts once its pair
    outnumbers the old one.
    Any key unknown (no registry given, the skill not found in one, the
    fixture not tracked in Git) makes the cell `insufficient`; there is no
    pool-everything fallback.
  * WHICH RUNS COUNT. Every validated run, whatever its billing, runner or
    location (#370); the verdict records each used run's `run` block and
    links its report. Validation is scripts/compute_gates.py's: a summary of
    the wrong shape skips its run with a reason (`MalformedSummary`), never a
    crash.
  * FIXTURE CLASS. No fixture carries a machine-readable class; DESIGN.md
    ("Four instruments, one harness") says a Class C fixture "says so in its
    `judge:` block: `mode: pairwise`". So a fixture is JUDGE-CARRIED (Class
    C) when its `judge.mode` is pairwise (`run_eval._judge_is_pairwise`) or
    it has no objective checks; when the fixture file is not available, when
    any trial's judge result is pairwise. compute_gates sets
    `judge_carried` on each run.

THE NUMBERS. A trial's pass rate is its checks passed over checks scored; its
judge figure is `overall` of an absolute result and `dimensions_mean` of a
pairwise one, a number from 0 to 10 (a skipped or failed judge result has
none). A trial with a FAILED check whose detail starts with the scorer's
own marker (`INFRASTRUCTURE_DETAIL_PREFIX`), or whose error type is one
(`INFRASTRUCTURE_ERRORS`), is an infrastructure error and is left out;
run_eval still scores it as it does today, the reclassification is made
here. Any other errored trial (an agent failure, a timeout, a budget stop)
is the agent's: it scores 0 on every check of the cell and has no judge
figure, since dropping it, or its run, would compare only the trials that
went well. A cell with any such trial can never be `no-benefit` (at most
`insufficient`; it can still show `benefit`), so errors can only help keep.
An arm of a run COUNTS when it has `MIN_TRIALS_PER_RUN` scored or
agent-errored trials and no scored trial without check results on a fixture
that has checks (`NO_CHECKS_REASON`, which also keeps the cell from
`no-benefit`); each cell records, under `skipped`, why its other runs did
not count. An arm's run mean is the mean of those trials' pass rates. Its
run judge figure is the mean of its trials' judge figures, and exists only
when the run judged unconditionally (`judge_conditional` false: run_eval
skips the judge when the with arm is already ahead on the objective, so
conditional scores are a sample biased toward no benefit) and every one of
those trials has a figure. A delta is mean(with run means) - mean(without
run means).

THE BOUNDS (`bounds`): at a one-sided `level`, the wider of a deterministic
percentile bootstrap over run means (`bootstrap_deltas`: each arm resampled
with replacement within itself, `bootstrap_resamples` times, a fixed seed
over sorted values) and a Welch t bound with Welch-Satterthwaite df floored
(at least 1; when its denominator underflows to 0 or is not finite, the
smaller arm's n - 1, at least 1), over FLOORED variances, so near-identical runs cannot make a
bound tighter than the trials behind them allow. For an objective delta,
overall or per check, each arm's variance of the mean is at least
p(1 - p)/n with p the arm's pooled pass rate and n its scored trials
(`binomial_floor`, p clipped to [1/(2n), 1 - 1/(2n)]). For a judge delta, it
is at least the pooled within-run variance of the trial judge figures over
the number of runs (`judge_floor`), pooled from the runs with two or more
judged trials. An arm with none (one trial per run, round 5, N1) has no
floor: the run-level standard error alone bounds its judge delta, and its run
judge figures must not all be equal (`_judge_spread_ok`); its objective floor
is still the binomial one with n its scored trials. With the committed margins, the objective
floor means an objective no-benefit needs hundreds of scored trials per arm
at a look (twenty runs of three trials at a 0.8 pass rate are not enough);
judge-carried cells are decided on the judge and its own floor. The t quantile is computed (`t_quantile`, the regularized incomplete
beta inverted by bisection), so Holm's adjusted levels need no table.
Levels: benefit uses the two-sided `benefit_confidence` interval's lower
end; no-benefit the one-sided `retire_confidence` upper bound; a check the
one-sided `check_confidence` lower bound, Holm-corrected across the
fixture's checks (`confident_checks`).

A CELL'S CLASS (`_classify`), first match wins:

  1. `insufficient`: an arm has fewer than `min_runs` counted runs, or the
     counted runs show fewer than `min_cli_versions` `harness.version`s.
  2. `cannot-discriminate`: some check fails in every scored trial of BOTH
     arms, or both arms' pooled pass rate <= `floor_fraction`.
  3. Zero variance: when every run mean of each arm is identical (the judge
     figures, for a judge-carried fixture), nothing is decided on it:
     `ceiling` if it qualifies, else `insufficient`. For a Class A or B
     fixture a judge figure that does vary may still show `benefit` first,
     since that only keeps.
  4. `benefit`: the objective delta's lower bound > 0; or some check
     confidently better with the skill (Holm); or, when the objective shows
     no confident gain, the judge delta's lower bound > 0. A judge-carried
     fixture keeps on any of the three too: its judge decides, but its
     objective checks are evidence of benefit. The judge figure is usable with
     `min_runs` judged runs per arm, at least two of them per arm with
     judge figures that differ within the run.
  5. `ceiling`: both arms' pooled pass rate >= `ceiling_fraction`; for a
     judge-carried fixture, both arms' mean judge figure >= `judge_ceiling`.
  6. `no-benefit`: the objective delta's `retire_confidence` upper bound <
     `objective_margin`, and the judge delta's < `judge_margin`; the judge
     figure must be usable and not of zero variance, since rule 4 only
     reached it when the objective showed no confident gain. A
     judge-carried fixture needs the judge's bound, and the objective's too
     whenever it has objective checks (a varying objective with `min_runs`
     runs per arm); without checks, the judge's alone.
  7. `insufficient`: the evidence is not tight yet.

STATELESS CONFIRMATION AT FIXED LOOKS (`classify_cell`, round-2 review,
2026-10-25). Nothing is carried from an earlier evaluation. Each arm's
counted runs are ordered by (timestamp, path). The class is computed at
every reachable look: each of `retire_looks` <= the smaller arm's counted
runs, on each arm's first N runs. `benefit` may be declared at any count, on
the whole pool. Otherwise the largest look decides: a class other than
`no-benefit` there is the cell's class; `no-benefit` at BOTH of the two
largest reachable looks is `no-benefit`; `no-benefit` at the largest alone
(one look reached, or the one before it was not) is `no-benefit-pending`.
So nothing retires before ten counted runs per arm, and since every look is
within the current pooling key, new content starts over. Before the first
look the whole pool's class stands. scripts/compute_gates.py reads no run
stamped after its `--as-of`, so an evaluation can be repeated as of a
time. A run is named by `run_key`,
`<path>#<fixture>#<role>`.

THE VERDICT (`retirement`), over every fixture on main x every current roster
arm model: any `benefit` -> `keep`; any `insufficient` or missing cell, or no
fixture on main -> `insufficient`; any `cannot-discriminate` ->
`cannot-discriminate`; any `ceiling` -> `ceiling`; any `no-benefit-pending`
-> `retire-pending`; `retire` only when there is at least one cell and
every cell is `no-benefit` (no roster model means no cell, never a
retirement); anything else `insufficient`. scripts/compute_gates.py then lets
one skill retire per evaluation. A standing retirement's stickiness, and
holding the one slot while a removal pull request is open, are part 2's: it
reads the open pull requests from GitHub rather than trusting an earlier
gates file.

KNOWN LIMITS, left for a later part:

  * Holm's m counts every check the fixture has, including checks constant
    in both arms that can never be confident, so the per-check keep is
    harder than it needs to be (Tarone's method would leave them out).
  * Scorer and harness changes are not part of the pooling key: runs scored
    before and after a scorer fix pool together.
  * An adopted skill's `tested_digest` is its frozen context's deployed copy,
    not the registry checkout's; when the two differ its runs do not pool
    (insufficient, never a wrong retire). Real-work fixtures
    (evals/real-work/, `subject: any`) are not a skill's fixtures on main,
    so their runs are not read.
