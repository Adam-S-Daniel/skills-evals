"""Hard-wrap reconstruction, shared by two callers that must agree.

`judge._normalize_draft_text` levels every draft to one line shape before the
judge sees it, and `objective.strip_seed_material` decides provenance a
SENTENCE at a time. Both first have to answer the same question: which line
breaks did the writer MEAN, and which did a wrap column put there? A wrap is
not a fact in the text — it has to be reconstructed — and two
reconstructions that disagreed would put the judge and the objective column
on different readings of the same draft, so there is one implementation and

    """The draft's estimated wrap column.

    Three questions, and they want different statistics, which is what this
    function got wrong twice:

    1. **Was anything wrapped at all?** Only a paragraph that runs to
       `WRAP_EVIDENCE_LINES` lines is evidence on its own: two could be a
       sign-off ("Thanks," / "Adam Daniel") or a heading and its one-line
       body. When NO paragraph reaches three lines the draft still has to be
       levelled — a reply hard-wrapped at 62 whose paragraphs all happen to
       come out two lines long is exactly the draft a line-shape tell picks
       out of a blind set — so the sample drops to paragraphs of two.
       Measured before this: such a draft, carrying one long careers URL,
       rendered as 12 lines with hard wraps of 63 and 66 surviving while
       both references rendered as 10 with none, deterministically, on every
       trial, on a dimension the rubric scores.
    2. **Is the sample plausible as a column?** The MEDIAN answers this and
       nothing else answers it as well: it ignores one odd line in either
       direction, so neither a sign-off's 7 nor an unbreakable URL's 89
       decides the verdict. Under `MIN_WRAP_COLUMN` the lines are short
       because the writer meant them to be — a paragraph of one-sentence
       lines, an address block — and joining on them would erase breaks the
       writer made, so the width goes up out of reach instead and nothing is
       joined.
    3. **Which column?** The MINIMUM of the lines that are long enough to be
       wraps at all. Every non-final line of a paragraph wrapped at column W
       is at most W, so the smallest of them is the most conservative
       estimate of W that the sample supports — and under-estimating is the
       safe direction: it can only join lines inside a paragraph that IS
       wrapped, while a deliberately short line (a 7-character sign-off) is
       never full enough to trigger the join at any of these widths. The
       median was the width as well as the plausibility test, and that
       under-joins RAGGED writing: a hand-wrapped paragraph of 58/72/49
       columns has a median of 65, the 58-character line is not "full" at
       65, and one hard wrap survived into the prompt.

    A line is a continuation of the one above it when the line above was too
    full for this line's first word to have fitted on it. That is what hard
    wrapping IS, and `width` is the estimated wrap column: the ragged last
    line of a wrapped paragraph ("than through a form.") is just as short as
    a sign-off, and only reconstructing the wrap tells them apart — the line
    above a ragged tail is full, the line above a sign-off is not.

    A line that STARTS a list item or a table row is never joined into the
    line above it, and nothing is joined into a table row: a list can follow
    a full line ("...easiest to see as a list:") and a row ends because the
    row ended. A list item's OWN continuation line is joined, though: it
    used not to be, and a hard-wrapped list therefore normalised to twice as
    many lines as its unwrapped twin — the exact line-shape tell this
    reconstruction exists to remove, surviving inside every draft that uses
    a list.

    Joined lines are collected and joined once at the end rather than
    appended onto a growing string: `out[-1] += ...` is quadratic in the
