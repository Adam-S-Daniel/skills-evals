"""evals/skills-doctor/one-row-rejects-the-lock.

The seed is a cloud session capture where one row of `skills.lock` carries an
uppercase digest, which the bootstrap hook's lock reader refuses, so the whole
lock is refused and none of its four skills installs. The skill's answer
counts every locked skill as affected, names the row, names the case as the
defect, and leaves the lock alone.

The shared contract (shape, anchoring, invented data, pristine asymmetry,
good result, one edit per check, whole wrong answers) is `FixtureContract` in
test_issue_skills_doctor_personal_copy_outranks_repo.py. Beyond it, this
module pins the seed fact the fixture rests on: the hook's own digest pattern
refuses this row and accepts the other three.

Discovered and run by test/run_tests.py; also runnable on its own with
`python3 -m pytest test/issues/test_issue_skills_doctor_one_row_rejects_the_lock.py -q`.

{CASE_SENTENCE} The refusal is of the whole lock and happens before the
install loop, so one bad row kept all four skills out of the session, which
is what the DEGRADED line's "could not read" says.

Nothing here was changed. Regenerate the lock with
scripts/generate_skills_lock.py rather than editing the row by hand.
