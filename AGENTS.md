## Fleet guidance is delivered once per session — not by this file

The account's full guidance — incidents, fleet policy, machine layout, the
traps that cost real outages — is installed into **user memory**
(`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) by the `fleet-memory` SessionStart hook, so it is
loaded **once per session** no matter how many repos are attached
([2026-08-29: inlined per repo, it took 332.3k tokens](https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/_agent-guidance/blob/main/docs/evidence/2026-08-29-guidance-inlined-in-every-repo.md)).

**Check the session-start verdict before you rely on it.** The hook prints one
line:

- `fleet-guidance: installed (v<id>, <n> bytes)` or `fleet-guidance: current` —
  the full guidance is in context. Use it.
- `fleet-guidance: DEGRADED — <reason>` — it is **not** in context. You have
  only what is below. Read `agents-md/base.md` in the `_agent-guidance`
  checkout (or on GitHub) before non-trivial work, and say in your reply that
  you were running degraded.
- `fleet-guidance: skipped (FLEET_GUIDANCE_SKIP set)` — also not in context,
  but by the machine owner's deliberate choice, not a fault. User memory is
  GLOBAL on a durable machine, so the guidance would otherwise load in every
  unrelated project on that box; `FLEET_GUIDANCE_SKIP` opts out and removes any
  block an earlier session installed. Read `agents-md/base.md` the same way you
  would when degraded — just don't report it as a problem or try to "fix" it.

No verdict at all means the hook never ran — treat that as DEGRADED.

## Codex reads the same block, from `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`

The hook writes the same block to `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` whenever `~/.codex`
exists — Codex's global **user** instructions, outside its 32 KiB
`project_doc_max_bytes` project-doc budget. Register it once per machine with
`scripts/register-codex-hook.sh` from an `_agent-guidance` checkout, then
trust it in `/hooks`. `codex debug prompt-input` renders instructions loaded
from disk by its own diagnostic process; it does not run SessionStart hooks
or inspect an existing session or daemon. Verify delivery in the launched
session's initial instructions and verdict; see the
[2026-10-04 evidence](https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/_agent-guidance/blob/main/docs/evidence/codex-trust-and-daemon-0160.md#prompt-debugging-source-read-2026-10-04-cli-01600-rust-v01600).

For Codex Cloud, use **Manual** environment setup with persistent
`CODEX_HOME=/opt/codex`. Preserve the repository's dependency setup and run
`bash .claude/hooks/fleet-memory.sh --codex-cloud` in both setup and
maintenance; reset the cache for the first verification. Fresh setup and
cached maintenance were verified in the `_agent-guidance` environment. See
[`docs/codex-cloud.md`](https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/_agent-guidance/blob/main/docs/codex-cloud.md).
If the Cloud shell has no `codex debug prompt-input`, the saved task response's
raw initial instruction envelope is the echo-free proof of model-visible
delivery.

## The floor: rules that hold even when the guidance did not load

These are the ones with teeth. They are restated here, deliberately, because a
session that lost the guidance must not also lose these.

- **Branch protection is real.** Fleet repos are PR-only on their default
  branch; a direct push is rejected (GH013), even from the repo's own
  workflows. Never design a bot that pushes to a protected default branch.
- **Every `uses:` is pinned: an exact tag locked in
  `.github/workflows/actions.lock` and checked by a required
  `gh actions-lock --verify` failing on any pin finding, or a full
  40-character commit SHA with no trailing version comment.** Cross-repo
  reusable workflows take a full SHA either way. The one carve-out is a ref
  into this account's own `cms-platform`, which stays on its release tag.
- **Never commit secrets or `.env` files, and never print personal data to a
  CI log** — logs, artifacts and git history on a public repo are public.
- **A successful `git push` does not mean your commit exists.** A refused
  pre-commit hook still lets the push report success. Verify with
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> origin/<branch>` — it is the only check
  that names both the commit and the ref.
- **"The watch finished" is not "CI passed."** Read the parsed conclusions;
  never infer pass/fail from a watch command's exit code.
- **A GitHub 404 means "not authorized", not "not there."** Never report a
  repo, PR or branch as gone on a 404 alone.
- **The fleet spans TWO owners** — `Adam-S-Daniel` and `jodidaniel`. A query
  scoped to one returns a plausible, complete-shaped, wrong answer.
- **Anything you name gets its link** — what you hand over, what you are
  waiting on, and what you cite as already done.
- **Merge with a merge commit** (`gh pr merge --merge`); do not amend
  published commits or force-push shared branches.
- **Keep this file under 32 KiB.** Codex truncates project instructions at
  that byte silently; the sync warns and the drift report flags
  `codex-truncated`.

## Repo-specific additions

<!-- Add your repo-specific agent guidance below this line -->

- **Evals programme handoff.** Read [`HANDOFF.md`](HANDOFF.md) first: the whole
  systematic-evals effort (skills and fleet guidance, six epics), where it
  stands, what is parked on Adam and why, and how to resume it. The live
  operational state is the status board,
  [skills-evals#126](https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/skills-evals/issues/126).

- **Running tests in a fresh or cloud session.** Run `bash scripts/dev_setup.sh`
  first: it installs what `ci.yml`'s `test` job installs (the pip pins and the
  four fixture `npm ci` directories), and `test/issues/test_issue_dev_setup.py`
  keeps the two in step. Then run the module that covers your change,
  `python3 -m pytest test/issues/<file>.py -q -n 2`, and report its count
  beside its exit code. `python3 -m unittest test.issues.<name>` cannot import
  (`test/` is not a package). The full suite,
  `python3 test/run_tests.py --jobs auto`, did not finish inside a 10-minute
  foreground command limit on 2 cores (2026-10-10), so start it in the
  background with its output in a log and poll, or let CI's `test` be the
  record. A cloud container has no `bwrap`, so tests of workspace-executing
  scorers fail closed there. Wrap any run in
  `unshare --user --map-current-user --pid --fork --mount-proc --`.

- **Workflow triggers and salient paths.** `test` (ci.yml) is the one
  required check. Keep this table in step when a trigger or filter moves.

  | Workflow | Triggers | Salient-path handling |
  |---|---|---|
  | `ci.yml` | `pull_request`, `push` to main, dispatch | `pull_request` unfiltered (required check); step `salient` gates the suite on `SALIENT_PATHS`, which must equal `on.push.paths` (`CiDispatchTests`) and includes `.github/workflows/actions.lock`, `.github/workflows/**` and `.github/actions/**`. The suite runs as a `suite` matrix of shards (`run_tests.py --shard K/N`, split by `test/shard.py`); the required `test` job passes only when every shard succeeded (`CiShardTests`) |
  | `propagation.yml` | `pull_request`, `push` to main, schedule, dispatch | deliberately unfiltered: it probes an unpinned upstream registry (its header says why). `coverage` is informational and not required: absent optional registry access makes its census unresolved without testing a PR, so PR/push/dispatch record a warning while schedule fails. Only `coverage-publish` on schedule writes `persistent/eval-results`; the optional private checkout uses a token minted from the read-only registry GitHub App (variable `REGISTRY_READ_APP_CLIENT_ID`, secret `REGISTRY_READ_APP_PEM`) in that checkout step alone. |
  | `dependabot-auto-merge.yml` | `pull_request`, schedule, dispatch | acts only on Dependabot PRs whose changes stay inside the manifest-path allowlist |
  | `eval.yml` | dispatch only | no push or PR trigger; Adam's 2026-10-06 decision retired its Tuesday schedule because the [weekly routine](https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/skills-evals/pull/331) replaces it |
  | `roster-refresh.yml` | schedule, dispatch | no push or PR trigger, so no path filter; dispatches eval.yml with roster_only=true weekly so the roster follows current use |
  | `scheduled-run-health.yml` | schedule, dispatch | no push or PR trigger, so no path filter |
  | `routine-eval-fire.yml` | dispatch only | none needed; its `run-name` carries the mode and target, which `scripts/improve_outcomes.py` and the allowance guard read |
  | `routine-eval-weekly.yml` | schedule only | no push or PR trigger; replaces `eval.yml`'s Tuesday schedule per Adam's 2026-10-06 decision; `scripts/plan_week.py` plans eval and improve fires by band within the allowance (ADR 0010 decision 4 addendum, 2026-10-26) and dispatches them one at a time through `routine-eval-fire.yml`, at most three in flight |
  | `routine-eval-results-pushed.yml` | `push` to `claude/eval-*` | `paths: eval-results/**` (the routine's pinned result root); holds no permissions and runs nothing from the branch |
  | `routine-eval-ingest.yml` | `workflow_run` of the above, dispatch | runs the default branch's copy only; `scripts/ingest_routine_results.py` validates the branch and writes `persistent/eval-results` `routine-results/<run id>/` (ADR 0010 decision 2) |
  | `routine-improve-pushed.yml` | `push` to `claude/eval-improve-*` | `paths: eval-improve/**` (the one directory an improve branch adds to; disjoint from `eval-results/**`, which is what keeps it off the results ingest); holds no permissions and runs nothing from the branch |
  | `routine-improve-gate.yml` | `workflow_run` of the above, dispatch | runs the default branch's copy only; `scripts/improve_gate.py` validates the branch without running it, builds the registry commits with no credential (`prepare`), then a PR in adam-agentskills is opened with a GitHub App token, minted only when secrets `EVAL_IMPROVE_APP_CLIENT_ID` and `EVAL_IMPROVE_APP_PEM` both exist; `evals/improve-policy.yml` `improve_merge_mode: auto` makes it ready with auto-merge (merge commit), `draft` (or a plugin that runs code) a draft (ADR 0005, routine improve mode and automatic merge addenda) |
  | `routine-scaffold-pushed.yml` | `push` to `claude/scaffold-*` | deliberately no path filter: every push must reach the gate, whose first job turns off auto-merge on the branch's open PR (an armed PR follows the branch); holds no permissions and runs nothing from the branch |
  | `routine-scaffold-gate.yml` | `workflow_run` of the above, dispatch | runs the default branch's copy only; `disarm` turns auto-merge off, `scripts/scaffold_real_work.py gate` validates the branch without running it (checker files must be the merge commit's own), then the roster App opens the PR ready, labeled `eval-scaffold`, with auto-merge on (merge commit, `--match-head-commit`); no App token opens a draft and arms nothing (ADR 0003's 2026-10-26 addendum) |
  | `routine-draft-skill.yml` | daily schedule, dispatch | no push or PR trigger, so no path filter; picks one `new-skill` lesson from adam-agentskills-private's `lessons/` on `persistent/lessons` (read-only registry App token), skipping drafted subjects and existing skills, re-admitting subjects whose hook proposal was closed as not planned, and dispatches draft mode through `routine-eval-fire.yml` when one fire fits the weekly allowance |
  | `routine-draft-skill-pushed.yml` | `push` to `claude/draft-skill-*` | `paths: draft-skill/**, evals/**` (the two directories a draft branch adds to; no other routine signal matches the branch); holds no permissions and runs nothing from the branch |
  | `routine-draft-skill-gate.yml` | `workflow_run` of the above, dispatch | runs the default branch's copy only; `scripts/draft_new_skill.py validate` judges the branch without running it; hook-first opens a `Hook proposal: <subject>` issue (job token, `issues: write`); accepted opens a skill PR in adam-agentskills (App token, as the improve gate) and then a fixtures PR here (job token, `contents: write`); both drafts, or in `improve_merge_mode: auto` (`improve_gate.py merge-mode`) both ready with auto-merge, the skill's first |
  | `routine-fixture-supply.yml` | daily schedule, dispatch | no push or PR trigger, so no path filter; mines merged fleet PRs, `scaffold_real_work.py pick` fires up to 3 new candidates in scaffold mode through `routine-eval-fire.yml` (within the allowance guard), and `scaffold_real_work.py promote` opens an auto-merging PR (roster App) that moves drafts with 2 clean ingested runs onto `evals/scheduled.yml` |
  | `skill-coverage.yml` | daily schedule, dispatch | no push or PR trigger; reads all four registries for a redacted census, publishes on schedule or explicit non-dry dispatch, and proposes up to three public GAP drafts; its `retirement` job runs on schedule only, computes the #70 verdicts from `persistent/eval-results` and acts on a `retire` one: in `retirement_mode: auto` (committed) a ready, `agent-authored`, auto-merging removal PR in adam-agentskills, written with the improve gate's GitHub App token (`EVAL_IMPROVE_APP_CLIENT_ID`/`EVAL_IMPROVE_APP_PEM`, minted under `continue-on-error` in the step before the one that uses it, passed as `REGISTRY_TOKEN`), with full registry history (`fetch-depth: 0`); with no token, or for a plugin that runs code, it files or updates a retirement issue instead (`issues: write`, `--fallback-to-proposal`); it opens nothing while an `eval-improve/`, `draft-skill/` or `retire-skill/` PR is open there; then does the same for one guidance section from a read-only `_agent-guidance` checkout (`--target guidance`, #124) |

### Action pins

Workflows name third-party actions by release tag; [`.github/workflows/actions.lock`](.github/workflows/actions.lock) locks each tag to an exact commit, and the runner runs the locked commit even when it disagrees with the tag. The `test` job's "Verify action lockfile" step is the shared action [`Adam-S-Daniel/verify-actions-lock`](https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/verify-actions-lock); it runs `gh actions-lock --verify` only when a PR touches workflow dependencies (`.github/workflows/**`, `.github/actions/**`, an `action.yml`/`action.yaml`) and fails on any finding except `cooldown-config-ignored` (dependabot.yml's cooldown `exclude`, which the tool ignores). It is early feedback, not the only guard: the runner rejects forged pins, and the repo will also turn on GitHub's Require lockfile policy. Write the exact tag by hand, regenerate with `gh actions-lock --no-narrow`, and commit both files; review an `actions.lock` diff as you would a SHA pin. A stale or moved pin is fixed with `gh actions-lock --accept-moved`; review the diff. A `reachability-unknown` failure means the GitHub API was unreachable: re-run. Cross-repo reusable workflows (`jobs.<id>.uses`) are not locked, so they take a full commit SHA (`Adam-S-Daniel/cms-platform` refs excepted); a test enforces it. Fleet rule: [ADR 0024](https://github.com/Adam-S-Daniel/_agent-guidance/blob/main/docs/decisions/0024-actions-pin-through-lockfiles.md).
